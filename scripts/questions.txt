Question 1:

User documentation is part of your definition of "Done." However, there aren't enough technical writers for all teams. Your Development Team doesn't have a technical writer. What should you do? (choose the best answer)

Wait until you have a technical writer on your Development Team to take care of this.
Your Development Team is still responsible for creating user documentation. In this case, the Development Team members will write it.
Let the user documentation remain undone and accumulate until after the last development Sprint It will then be done by any available technical writers.
Form a separate team of technical writers that will work on an on demand basis for the various Product Owners. Work order will be first in, first out.


Answer: B.



Explanation

Waiting for a Technical writer can not be an option. Also, if we keep the documentation undone it will further delay the process. Only to prepare the documentation we cannot form a new team hence we are left with only one option Your Development Team is still responsible for creating user documentation. In this case, the Development Team members will write it.



Question 2:

Which of the following are criteria to order Product Backlog items? (choose all that apply)

Dependencies between Product Backlog items.
Dependencies to other products.
Value of Product Backlog items.
The availability of the Scrum Master.
All of the above.


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

Dependencies to other products and availability of Scrum Master are not criteria to order the items in the product backlog.



Question 3:

In order to maximize the value of the product, a Product Owner needs awareness of the following: (choose the best answer)

Customer feedback.
None of the above.
Forecasting & feasibility.
Product vision.
Competitive research.
All of the above


Answer: A.



Explanation

Customer feedback is the main criteria for the Product Owner to judge over the product release and features.



Question 4:

The "cone of uncertainty" can be used to do what? (choose the best answer)

Project what will be completed by a given Sprint.
Illustrate that, as a forecast lengthens, it is increasingly less certain.
Determine the cost of a project before it is begun.
Determine whether to cut quality, similar to the Iron Triangle of project management.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The cone of uncertainty is the unknown parameters of the project and it gets reduced as further we move towards the project end. Hence it is expected that we can use it to estimate the project cost initially.



Question 5:

Which three of the following are feedback loops in Scrum? (choose the best three answers)

Release Planning.
Refinement Meeting.
Sprint Retrospective.
Sprint Review.
Daily Scrum.


Answer: C, D, E.



Explanation

Release Planning, and Refinement Meeting are not scrum events to get feedback. The remaining 3 are.



Question 6:

Which two things should the Development Team do during the first Sprint? (choose the best two answers)

Develop at least one piece of functionality.
Analyze, design, and describe the complete architecture and infrastructure.
Analyze, describe, and document the requirements for the subsequent Sprints.
Create an Increment of potentially releasable software.
Make up a plan for the rest of the project.


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

Develop at least one piece of functionality. Create an Increment of potentially releasable software. are the two things that can be done in the first sprint. For an Agile project, a complete plan is never prepared at a go. Also, analyzing and creating complete architecture for subsequent sprint or for total project is not done in the first sprint.



Question 7:

Which does a self-organizing Development Team choose? (choose the best answer)

Product Backlog ordering.
When to release, based on its progress.
How to best accomplish its work
Sprint length.
Stakeholders for the Sprint Review.


Answer: C.



Explanation

How to best accomplish its work because they know the best way to do their job.



Question 8:

The Scrum Master Observes the Product Owner struggling with ordering the Product Backlog. What is an appropriate action for the Scrum Master to take? (choose the best answer)

Present the Product Owner with an ordered Product Backlog to use
Encourage the Product Owner to work with the Development Team to see which items technically are fastest to implement
Suggest the Product Owner extend the Sprint, so he can have more time to order the Product Backlog.
Offer the Product Owner help in understanding that the goal of ordering the Product Backlog is to maximize value.
Suggest that the Development Team does the ordering to be sure that it is a feasible ordering of work.


Answer: D.



Explanation

The Development Team cannot order the product backlog. Also, extending the sprint cannot be an option. Scrum master cannot prepare the entire Product backlog all by himself. And the objective should be to deliver the highest value item not the fastest one.

Hence we are left with only one option. Offer the Product Owner help in understanding that the goal of ordering the Product Backlog is to maximize value.



Question 9:

What is a Product Owner’s responsibility that he/she might delegate?

Attending the Sprint Review
Representing stakeholders to the Scrum team
Ordering the Product Backlog
Writing User Stories


Answer: C.



Explanation

The development team may need to order the product backlog as they would know the most about technical limitations, risks, or dependencies between Product Backlog Items. As User Stories is a localized practice, Scrum does not govern it or dictate the practice. How the team describes the items is up to them as long as it has enough information to be transparent and understood.



Question 10:

A new Product Owner is hired to work on an existing product that is ongoing for five Sprints. He/she is unsure about all of the responsibilities of a Product Owner. Which of these Product Owner's activities are defined in Scrum?

Ensuring work is completed within scope and time.
Describing features as Use Cases.
Interacting with stakeholders and ensuring that the most valuable functionality is always produced first.
Writing User Stories.


Answer: C.



Explanation

It is only the PO responsibility to talk to stakeholders and ensure that the most valuable items are selected to deliver in sprint.



Question 11:

Peter is a new Product Owner on a newly formed Scrum Team. Peter has Projected a product completion date based on an estimated velocity of 21 completed points per Sprint. After the first 3 Sprints, the team has determined that their maximum velocity is 15 point's, and they are unable to create shippable increments at the end of each Sprint. What is the best way to proceed?

Inform Peter that the projected completion date is not correct. The Development team would estimate the remaining work to produce a shippable Increment and suggest making it ‘Done” before working on new features. Based on empirical data, Peter car’ adjust the completion date and decide how to continue.
The Sprints have failed to produce shippable Increments therefore opportunities to inspect and adapt are lost. The Scrum Master would encourage the organization to add more team members in order to increase the team’s capacity.
The Scrum Master would coach the team on improving their estimations and commitment to completing the Sprint Backlog.
Extend the Sprint in order to complete the Sprint Backlog items.


Answer: A.



Explanation

Inform Peter that the projected completion date is not correct. The Development team would estimate the remaining work to produce a shippable increment and suggest making it “Done” before working on new features. Based on empirical data, Peter can adjust the completion date and decide how to continue.



Question 12:

Which of the following might the Scrum Team discuss during a Sprint Retrospective? (choose the best answer)

Its definition of “Done.”
Skills needed to improve the Development Team's ability to deliver.
Methods of communication.
The way the Scrum Team does Sprint Planning.
All of the above.


Answer: A, B, C, D.



Explanation

All of the points are points to be discussed during Sprint Retrospective.



Question 13:

Why would you expect a Product Owner to care about the Development Team adhering to its definition of "Done"? (choose the best two answers)

To forecast the team’s productivity over time.
The Product Owner should not care about the definition of Done”, it is the Development Teams responsibility.
To have complete transparency into what has been done at the end of each Sprint
To be able to punish the team when they don’t meet their velocity goal for the Sprint.
The definition of “Done” can affect the product’s total cost of ownership.


Answer: C, E.



Explanation

Team productivity cannot be forecasted by PO, punishing is not a valid act in Scrum, being a member of Scrum PO must be cared about definition of done.



Question 14:

Towards the end of the Sprint, the developers and yourself are debating if some of the Sprint Backlog Items were completed or not. The Scrum Master suggests to you and the developers to refer to the Definition of Done (DoD). Who should set up the DoD?

The Scrum Team unless the organization already has one. In that case, they should follow the Definition of Done as a minimum.
The developers as they are the ones doing the actual work of converting the Sprint Backlog Items into an Increment
You as Product Owner have the authority to decide what is done and what is not.
The Scrum Master as he/she knows how Scrum works and what fit best in an Agile environment


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Scrum Team unless the organization already has one. In that case, they should follow the Definition of Done as a minimum. DoD is a collective process.



Question 15:

Which statements are correct about a Sprint Backlog item that was not finished until the end of the Sprint? Select all correct answers.

It won't be demonstrated at the Sprint Review meeting
It must be completed in the next Sprint
It will be moved back to the Product Backlog
It will be demonstrated to the stakeholders but pointed out that its not complete yet
The Product Owner has to extend the Sprint until the item is done


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

Only the 100% complete items are demonstrated, to avoid confusion. When something is not complete, it will be moved back to the Product Backlog. If it's still on the top of the Product Backlog, development will continue in the next Sprint (if it will be required)



Question 16:

The forecast is that we can't develop all items in the Sprint Backlog. Who reviews and makes decisions related to this issue?

The Scrum Master
The Developers and the Product Owner
The Business Analyst
The whole Scrum Team
The Solution Architect
The Developers


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog but always can and must consider the feedback and opinion from other stakeholders including the Developers who can influence to add new items in Product Backlog. Good requirements should be brief enough, that’s why acceptance tests can be used to express many of the details that result from the conversations between customers, users, Product Owners and Developers, including non-functional requirements. One product only has one Product Backlog.



Question 17:

Who participates in the Sprint Review? (choose all options that apply).

The Product Owner.
The Developers.
The Scrum Master.
Senior Management.
The Application Manager.
The Key Stakeholders.


Answer: A, B, C, F.



Explanation

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

The Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. It is not just a presentation but rather it is a working session.



Question 18:

Selena, a product owner for a scrum team, has refined the product backlog based on description, order, and size. John, a program manager with the PMO overseeing the group of projects Selena is working on & requested her to place a new item at the top of the product backlog. What should Selena do? (choose the best option)

Selena should not be doing anything with the product backlog; this responsibility belongs to developers.
Selena is accountable for the product backlog; so John doesn't have authority to request any new item or change the order product backlog.
Selena must do as John has asked as John is an important stakeholder (PMO).
Selena may consider the request of others, but the final say as to the order is hers and hers alone.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner is accountable for effective Product Backlog management but that doesn't mean he/she should not consider others opinions. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner. So Selena should consider John's request but she has the final say to move or not the item to the top of the product backlog.

Product Backlog management, which includes:

●      Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;

●      Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;

●      Ordering Product Backlog items; and

●      Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and understood.



Question 19:

The Product Owner should communicate all of the marketplace knowledge & ever-changing landscape, environment to the Scrum Team. What is the best way for a Product Owner to communicate this to the Scrum Team ? (choose all options that apply)

During Product Backlog Refinement.
During Sprint Retrospectives.
During Daily Scrums.
During Sprint Review.


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

The Product Owner communicates all of this marketplace knowledge to the Scrum Team through daily ad-hoc interactions as well as Product Backlog Refinement and in Sprint Reviews. During Product Backlog Refinement Product owner creates and clearly communicates Product Backlog items along with Product Goal. During Sprint review the Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.

Sprint Retrospective & Daily Scrum are not the right forum to discuss this as Daily Scrum is for Developers & Sprint Retrospective is for inspecting the scrum team and creating a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.



Question 20:

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software is an Agile Principle. Which scrum practice helps the most in achieving this Agile objective? (choose the best option).

Daily Scrum.
Sprint.
Release Planning.
Sprint Planning.
Sprint Review.


Answer: B.



Explanation

Sprint: Short Sprint Cycles. Having shorter sprints would enable teams to deliver early and the cycle of such deliveries would make it continuous delivery to the customer. Sprint planning is there irrespective of the sprint period.



Question 21:

Mark is a product owner for a scrum team. He decides for each sprint what items will go into the sprint backlog during sprint planning. He is growing increasingly frustrated with developers not able to complete the task items he has chosen for the sprint. What should Mark do to help developers reach the sprint goal?

(choose the best option)

Mark should work with the scrum master to find a resolution to this issue.
Mark should encourage developers to work more hours, spending weekends if necessary working towards completing the sprint goal.
Mark should work more closely with developers; items should not be added to the sprint backlog unless developers can commit to completing the items within the sprint.
Mark should work to find more competent developers able to deliver what he decides for each sprint


Answer: C.



Explanation

During the Sprint no changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal. As developers work, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than developers expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint. So Mark should work more closely with developers; items should not be added to the sprint backlog unless developers can commit to completing the items within the sprint



Question 22:

Scrum Teams are self-managed and cross-functional. How time-boxing promotes self-management? (choose all options that apply).

Time-box does not allow enough time for stringent processes or meeting overhead.
Time-box eliminates complexity due to organizational hierarchy.
Time-box enables Scrum Team to determine the need for overtime as a percentage of the time-box.
Time-box helps everyone to focus on the same problem at the same time.
Time-box encourages team members who are closest to the problem to create the best possible solution in  the time allotted.


Answer: D, E.



Explanation

Time-boxes help everyone focus on the same problem at the same time. Also, it encourages the people who are closest to the problem to create the best possible result in the time allotted, given the current context.



Question 23:

True or False, In large organizations multiple scrum teams work on the same product. In this scenario, does the Scrum Team use a single Product Backlog?

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.



Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work on the product i.e. it is a one to one relationship between Product and Product Backlog. In this scenario, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.



Question 24:

Who is responsible for setting the timeboxed duration of Sprints?

The Product Owner.
The Team Leader.
The Scrum Team.
The Development Manager.
The Developers.
The Solution Architect.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The only titles that we have in Scrum are Developers, Scrum Master and Product Owner. This is done by the whole Scrum Team, because they can contribute something important that leads to a better decision.



Question 25:

After Sprint Planning, the Product Owner finds that it makes sense to develop a new functionality. (choose the best option)

Developers will add that to the Sprint Backlog.
Developers can review that for selection in the next Sprint
Developers can swap existing functionality for the new functionality.
Developers can create a technical spike & pull this to the current sprint.


Answer: B.



Explanation

Product Owner can't introduce new functionality in the middle of the Sprint unless developers get more capacity to work and they mutually agree to take this in. After the Product Owner adds the new functionality and orders it to be on the top of the Product Backlog, developers can review that for selection in the next Sprint Planning.



Question 26:

In a Retrospective, a Scrum Team decides to revise the Sprint length. Pick the statements which are correct about Sprint length. (choose the best three options)

Sprint length can extend as long as required to complete all the work identified in Sprint Backlog.
It is better to have Sprints of consistent length through Scrum journey.
The new Sprint length needs to be agreed by the Product Owner.
Sprint can have a maximum duration of one month.


Answer: B, C, D.



Explanation

The Product Owner needs to ensure that it is short enough to limit business risks and also short enough so the team can synchronize the development work with other business events. Please note that the finalized Sprint length cannot be longer than 1 calendar month.



Question 27:

James is a product owner for a scrum team. The customer has expressed concerns about releasing new software after every sprint. What should James do? (choose the best option)

An increment must be released after a sprint James should insist on longer sprints to meet the customers longer release cycle.
An increment only needs to be potentially releasable, James may hold back several increments and work with the customer on a release schedule that fits their needs.
James should ask the scrum master to put together a release planning meeting to help convince the customer of the value of incremental release.
An increment must be released after a sprint James should explain to the customer what scrum is and how scrum handles releases.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in usable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of "Done”. The increment must be in usable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.



Question 28:

Mark is a product owner for a scrum team. He wants to get some additional product backlog items added to the current sprint backlog. Sprint planning has already happened, what should Mark do? (choose the best option)

Mark should bring it up at a daily scrum meeting and discuss it with developers; adding additional time to the daily scrum if needed.
Mark should hold a separate meeting with developers and discuss the options of adding some additional items; developers can consider the possibility and may be able to accommodate the additional work.
Mark should just add the items to the sprint backlog, the self managing Developers will figure out the best way to accommodate the additional work.
Mark should consult with the scrum master; the scrum master will make the final call as to whether the work will be added to the current sprint


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that developers identify as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal. Developers modify the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This emergence occurs as developers work through the plan and learn more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal. As new work is required, developers add it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only developers can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. So Mark should discuss with Developers the possibility of accommodating this additional work.



Question 29:

Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. Who has the final deciding authority on whether to release it or not? (choose the best option).

Developers.
The Product Owner.
The Scrum Master.
The Scrum Team.
The stakeholders


Answer: D.



Explanation

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.



The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. In the past, the Product Owner was the release decision-maker but now the release decision is on the whole scrum team.



Question 30:

The Developers find out during the Sprint that they are not likely to build everything they forecast. What would you expect a Product Owner to do? (choose the best answer)

Cancel the Sprint.
Skip Product Backlog refinement activities.
Change the Sprint Goal.
Renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Developers.
Inform management that more resources are needed.


Answer: D.



Explanation

During the Sprint. scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Developers as more is learned.



Question 31:

When does a Developer become accountable for the value of a Product Backlog item selected for the Sprint? (choose the best answer)

Never. The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating value every Sprint
During the Daily Scrum.
Whenever a team member can accommodate more work.
At the Sprint Planning Event


Answer: A.



Explanation

All members of the Scrum Team share in the accountability for creating value every Sprint.



Question 32:

True or false. Our velocity was 250 at the end of the 6th Sprint. It becomes 275 at the end of the 8th Sprint. Therefore, we're creating more value now compared to before.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

FALSE, There's no direct relationship between velocity (speed) and value; e.g., maybe we're working faster on less valuable items, in which case, velocity will be higher, but value may be the same, higher, or lower. Many people consider velocity as the most important criterion, but that's not true -- we should rather be focused on value, Sprint Goal, and Product Goal.



Question 33:

The Product Owner decides not to create a Product Goal. In this case select all correct answers.

It is up to the Product Owner
Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless
The Scrum Master is helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
The Product Owner must discuss with Developers and if they are ok with it, then he or she may remove the Product Goal


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

As we know from the Scrum Guide while implementing only parts of Scrum is possible (by removing the Product Goal), the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices. In this case, the best action from the Scrum Master to discuss it with the Product Owner and find techniques for effective Product Goal definition



Question 34:

True or False. The key stakeholders are expected to participate in the Sprint Review

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders in the Sprint Review and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.



Question 35:

What is the main responsibility of a tester in Scrum?

Writing the test scripts as soon as the programmers start working on the code
Finding bugs
There are no testers in Scrum
Verifying the work of Developers


Answer: C.



Explanation

There are no members titled as testers, because we don't have extra accountabilities and titles in Scrum. However, there can be Developers who are experts in testing. Remember that everyone is called a Developer. When you see a statement like "Developer with testing expertise" in your real exam, it usually means "tester" as an accountability or title, rather than a person who's expert in testing.



Question 36:

The Product Backlog is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. How should a Product Backlog item be refined when it is located at the top? Select all correct answers. Choose ALL answers that apply.

It should be clear which developer is responsible for it.
In a way that it can be,“Done” in the timeboxed duration of one Sprint
In a way that's clear enough for the developers.
All the tasks required for completing it should be identified.


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

Items at the top of the Product Backlog should be small enough to fit in one Sprint. They should also be clear and detailed enough; but not too detailed (e.g. not with all the tasks identified), as it would be upfront planning. Tasks are created gradually during the Sprint. Product Backlog items require multiple expertise and are usually done by multiple developers. Therefore, they are not assigned. Tasks, however, are assigned to the individual developers, while everyone stays accountable.



Question 37:

Why should there be only one Product Owner per product? Choose only ONE best answer.

There should be one Product Owner for each team. If more than one team is working on the same product, multiple Product Owners might be needed.
Developers know who’s responsible for prioritization
One person ¡s always enough for this role
It becomes confusing when more than one Product Owner ¡s managing the team.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner. For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one can force Developers to work from a different set of requirements and developers know who’s responsible for prioritization.



Question 38:

This accountability in Scrum must know the most about the product and performance of the product. Choose only ONE best answer.

The Scrum Master
The Scrum Team
The Product Owner
The project manager
The Product Master


Answer: C.



Explanation

Measuring the release or product performance is the Product Owner's responsibility. Measuring Sprint performance is the responsibility of Developers.



Question 39:

What of the following are key factors within the Scrum Team to organize themselves?

Having all the competencies required to accomplish the work without depending on others
They should be transparent to the Team Lead
They should be self-managed
They should make sure that they have frequent meetings with the software architects


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

The Scrum Team should be self-managing and cross-functional and they should find the best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.



Question 40:

The main goal for the Product Owner is to maximize the value of the product. But how should the Product Owner forecast the completion date? Choose only one best answer.

By any method the PO finds appropriate
By dividing the remaining amount of work in the Product Backlog to the latest calculated velocity
By using a trend line in the burn-down chart
It is not the responsibility of the Product Owner. The Scrum Master must forecast the completion date


Answer: A.



Explanation

Using a trend line in the burn-down chart can help (if the team is using that chart), as well as simple or complex formulas such as the one mentioned above. But all of these are just guides for the Product Owner and she should consider all factors and come up with a reliable completion date forecast.



Question 41:

In Scrum, when a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as "Done", everyone in the team must understand what "Done" means. From the following answers, choose the LEAST accurate statement about the Definition of "Done"? Choose only one best answer.

The Product Owner creates it
The Scrum Team may define it
It may vary depending on the product
It may evolve during the product life


Answer: A.



Explanation

The DoD is not created by the Product Owner. If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriately for the product.



Question 42:

True or False. The Product Owner should be expertly aware of the marketplace for the product.

True
False
It depends


Answer: A.



Explanation

Product Owner should be expertly aware of the marketplace for the product. They should constantly be gathering and re-gathering information and data regarding the marketplace so that the product value is maximized. Getting out of touch with the marketplace can be a recipe for product disaster.



Question 43:

True or False. The Product Owner is the sole person accountable for managing the Product Backlog.

False
True


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner is accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:

Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal; Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items; Ordering Product Backlog items; and, Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.



Question 44:

Select 2 true statements about Scrum. Choose all answers that apply.

Scrum is a methodology for managing complex projects
Scrum is a traditional process but with Sprints and related artifacts
Scrum is a framework  for developing and maintaining complex products.
Scrum is based on empirical process control theory


Answer: C, D.



Explanation

Scrum is a framework, not a methodology or body of knowledge. Scrum is empirical, rather than theoretical. Scrum is more about project delivery rather than project management. Scrum is adaptive, rather than predictive (it's more than just using Sprints and related artifacts). Scrum should be used entirely (we do not tailor it)



Question 45:

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. The stakeholders are invited to the Sprint Review in order to:

Choose only one best answer.

Provide feedback on the team working style
Provide feedback on Scrum implementation
Provide feedback on the Increment
Provide feedback on design and architecture


Answer: C.



Explanation

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.



Question 46:

The Product Backlog Refinement is not a mandatory event in Scrum. However, almost all Scrum Teams are holding this event. From the following answers select all correct benefits of the Product Backlog Refinement. Choose all answers that apply.

Clarify Value
Reduce Dependencies
Decrease velocity
Improve relationship in the Scrum Team
Incorporate Learning


Answer: A, B, E.



Explanation

In general there are 6 important benefits of the PBR. Here they are:

●      Increase transparency

●      Clarify value

●      Break things into consumable pieces

●      Reduce dependencies

●      Forecasting

●      Incorporate learning



Question 47:

A stakeholder is a person external to the Scrum Team with a specific interest in and knowledge of a product that is required for incremental discovery. Who are the typical key stakeholders in Scrum? Select all correct answers.

The people responsible for making the funding decisions for the product development effort
The people responsible for product marketing
The people who actually use the product under development
The people responsible for paying to use the product
The people responsible for product development
The people from the security department


Answer: A, C, D.



Explanation

Typical stakeholder is the man who is responsible for making the funding decisions for the product development effort, the user of the product, the man who is responsible for paying to use the product



Question 48:

Which of the following is the LEAST productive way for the Scrum Master to improve communication between Developers and the Product Owner? Choose only ONE best answer.

Giving the order to all members of the team and act as a go-between for them
Suggest effective communication tools and techniques to the Product Owner
Monitor their communication performance
Teach them how to communicate effectively


Answer: A.



Explanation

Acting as a go-between weakens the team. Also, the Scrum Master is not the team leader (in people management), he or she can't manage the team and give any order. But The Scrum Master is supposed to teach and coach and be the leader in serving the team.



Question 49:

One of the most challenging activities in Scrum is Product Backlog Refinement (although the PBR is not an event in Scrum). How should a Product Backlog item be refined before its development begins? Select all correct answers.

In a way that it's clear enough for Developers
It should be clear which member of the Scrum Team is responsible for it.
In a way that it can be “Done in the time-boxed duration of one Sprint
All the tasks required for completing it should be identified.


Answer: A, C



Explanation

A Product Backlog should be refined in a way that it's clear enough for Developers and it can be "Done" in the time-boxed duration of one Sprint



Question 50:

Which two statements are correct during the Sprint? Choose all answers that apply.

The scope may be clarified as more is learned
Some Sprint Backlog items will be replaced with items from the Product Backlog if the priorities change
The scope may be re-negotiated as more is learned
Some Sprint Backlog items would be moved back to the Product Backlog to be completed in future Sprints


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

During the Sprint: No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal; Quality goals do not decrease; and, Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Developers as more is learned.



Question 51:

The most important stakeholder wants a new feature to be added to the current Sprint. What is the best response for Developers in this situation? Choose only one best answer.

Ask the Product Owner to work with the customer
Reject the request
Add the item to the bottom of the Sprint Backlog
Swap the item with one of the items in the Sprint Backlog
Add the item to the Product Backlog


Answer: A.



Explanation

No one can add additional items to the Product Backlog (source for development work) except the Product Owner. First stakeholder has to discuss it with the Product Owner



Question 52:

How many Product Goals can a Scrum team have at a moment? Choose only one best answer.

No more than 3 Product Goals
No more than 1 Product Goal
Unlimited numbers of Product Goals


Answer: B.



Explanation

You can only have one Product Goal, so when the current Product Goal is achieved a new one would be created. If there is a significant change in context and the current Product Goal has not been achieved then the Scrum Team would replace the Product Goal with a more fitting one. If the Product is no longer relevant in the market (remember floppy disks, video cassettes, etc ), then the organization would either pivot or fold.



Question 53:

A Definition of Done drives the quality of work and is used to assess when a task has been completed. But what are the benefits of having tests in the definition of “Done”? Select all correct answers.

Increments would be closer to being potentially shippable
Increased transparency and the quality of the Increments
Increments would be more complete
Reporting would be easier for the project manager


Answer: A,B,C.



Explanation

Developers deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This Increment is usable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it. If the definition of "Done" for an increment is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If "Done" for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, Developers of the Scrum Team must define a definition of "Done" appropriate for the product. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, Developers on all Scrum Teams must mutually define the definition of "Done". Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.



As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of "Done" will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality. New definitions, as used, may uncover work to be done in previously “Done” increments. A product or system should have a definition of "Done" that is a standard for any work done on it.



Question 54:

The Scrum Team has just finished the Sprint Planning. According to this, choose all correct statements from the following answers. Choose all answers that apply.

After the Sprint Planning, a Sprint cannot proceed without complete requirement specification
After the Sprint Planning, a Sprint cannot proceed  without a Sprint Goal
After the Sprint complete Sprint Planning, a Sprint can proceed without Backlog
After the Sprint Planning, a Sprint cannot proceed without complete design and BRD or FSD


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides guidance to Developers on why they are building the increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. As new work is required, Developers add it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed.



Question 55:

According to the Scrum Guide, that is the reason why the Daily Scrum should be held at the same time and the same place. Choose only one best answer.

Developers
Product Owner
Scrum Master
Scrum Team


Answer: B.



Explanation

The PO ensures that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next. The Product Owner is the Lead Facilitator of Key Stakeholder Involvement. The PO is responsible for identifying the key stakeholders for the product and involving them as necessary throughout the development effort.



Question 58:

Question 63:

There are many responsibilities in Scrum for the Product Owner. From the following answers choose three of them .Choose all answers that apply.

Break down epic items into smaller ones
Create user stories (if the Scrum Team uses user story format as a task)
Prioritize the Product Backlog
Design Software
Facilitate meetings
Provide estimates
Make technical decisions


Answer: A, B, C.



Explanation

Designing the software is part of the development and should be done by the developers. They make technical decisions, and volunteer for tasks (assign them to themselves). Estimation is the responsibility of the developers because they are the people who will develop the item. The rest (from the following) are done by the Product Owner.



Question 64:

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. The stakeholders are invited to the Sprint Review in order to:

Choose only one best answer.

Provide feedback on the team working style
Provide feedback on Scrum implementation
Provide feedback on the Increment
Provide feedback on design and architecture


Answer: C.



Explanation

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.



Question 65:

When is an item in the Sprint Backlog considered complete?

When there’s nothing more we need to do before it can be used by end users
When the Sprint is over
When the whole Scrum Team agrees that it’s complete
When user acceptance tests are passed


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Scrum Team can't agree that it's complete, there's a limit to self-management. It's possible to not even start working on an item before the Sprint is over, so you can't call it complete. A Product Backlog item that you have in the Sprint Backlog is Done, when it can be part of a Done Increment. Increments have to be Done based on the Definition of Done.



Question 66:

Which of the following are needed in order to allow Sprint Planning to begin?

(choose the best two answers)

A fully refined Product Backlog.
A clear cadence of when the Daily Scrum will take place.
A Product Backlog with the most important items ready for discussion.
Formal budget approval to conduct another Sprint
A Product Goal communicated by the Product Owner
A clear and non-negotiable Sprint Goal.


Answer: C, E.



Explanation

Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal.



Question 67:

How important is it for a Product Owner to order Product Backlog items by using value points? (choose the best answer)

Using value points is the ultimate way for a Product Owner to predict the value that the product will provide.
Calculating value points ¡s a predictive approach that conflicts with the empiricism of Scrum, and is therefore not acceptable.
The Product Owner may order the Product Backlog by using value points or select another technique, the  decision is up to them.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Product Owner is accountable for ordering the Product backlog, regardless of the techniques they may utilize to define that order. Indications of value on Product Backlog items may be useful but are only a prediction until validated by users and the market.



Question 68:

When can the Product Backlog be updated? (choose the best answer)

Never, unless agreed to by the change request
Only after a Sprint Review if agreed to by the stakeholders.
At any time when done by the Product Owner or a  delegate.
Only during Product Backlog refinement sessions if the Product Owner is present.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Product Backlog is dynamic: it constantly changes to identify what the product needs in order to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or a delegate. Even if the responsibility is delegated the Product Owner remains accountable for the Product Backlog.



Question 69:

Which two statements explain why the Definition of Done is important to the Product Owner? (choose the best two answers)

It identifies undone work that can be addressed in a separate Sprint
It creates transparency regarding progress within the  Scrum Team.
It helps the Product Owner track the open work during a Sprint
It establishes the expected quality of the Increment reviewed at the Sprint Review.


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

All Scrum Team members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete. to ensure transparency. This is the Definition of Done for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment. The Increment reviewed at the Sprint Review must meet the Definition of Done.



Question 70:

The Product Owner has the final call over the requirements and should involve the stakeholders as little as possible.
The Product Owner actively asks for stakeholder input and expectations to incorporate into the Product Backlog.


Answer: D.



Explanation

The Product Owner represents the stakeholders to the Scrum Team. which includes representing their desired requirements in the Product Backlog. The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management.



Question 75:

Adaptation requires regular inspection. In what ways does the Product Owner contribute to the results achieved by inspection? (choose the best two answers)

The Product Owner inspects the Sprint burn-down at the Daily Scrum for progress towards a complete Increment and re-planning the team's work.
The Product Owner invites stakeholders to the Sprint Review to learn how the current state of the marketplace influences what is the most valuable thing to do next.
The Product Owner verifies the Sprint Backlog for completeness at the end of Sprint Planning in order to allow the Sprint to start.
The Product Owner shares the current state of Product Backlog at the Sprint Review, which, combined with the  inspection of the Increment leads to an updated Product Backlog.


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress to detect undesirable variances. The primary tool for the Product Owner to uphold transparency is the Product Backlog. Product Backlog is a living artifact that is actively maintained and updated to reflect reality. At the Sprint Review, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. which is processed into an updated Product Backlog.



Question 76:

To what extent does technical debt limit the value a Product Owner can get from a product? (choose the best two answers)

Technical debt causes a greater percentage of the product's budget to be spent on maintenance of the product.
The velocity at which new functionality can be created is reduced when you have technical debt
Technical debt is not a Product Owner concern, technical debt is only an issue for the Developers.
Technical debt does not influence the delivery of value.


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

Technical debt does influence and it is a concern of the PO.



Question 77:

True or False: A first Sprint can start before the Product Owner has a complete and exhaustive Product Backlog in place.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

A first Sprint requires no more than a Scrum Team and enough ideas to potentially complete a full Sprint.



Question 78:

How do timeboxes help the Product Owner and the other members of the Scrum Team validate assumptions, adapt, and maximize the value of their product? (choose the best answer)

Timeboxes help by making sure a Sprint does not stop until all testing is done, and the work is verified by the Product Owner
Timeboxes assure the Product Owner that the Developers will finish all work on the Sprint Backlog by the end of the Sprint.
At the end of each Sprint when the timebox expires a detailed report with all test cases and test results is available.
Timeboxes help minimize risk by creating the opportunity to validate assumptions using feedback from users and the market; allowing Scrum Teams to inspect progress toward the Product Goal and decide whether to pivot or persevere.


Answer: D.



Explanation

The Product Owner manages the Product Backlog against the assumption that value will be generated. This assumption remains invalidated when not checked against users and the market. When a Sprints horizon is too long. you increase the risk that what is being developed may no longer be desired. Sprints limit risk to one calendar month or less of work.



Question 79:

Which statement best describes Scrum here? (choose the best answer)

A cookbook that defines best practices for software development
A defined and predictive process that conforms to the principles of Scientific Management.

Question 18:

From the following answers, how should developers deal with system, security or non-functional features? Choose only one best answer.

Incorporate them in the hardening Sprint
Incorporate them into every Increment
Incorporate them before the release
Incorporate them in the integration Sprint


Answer: B.



Explanation

Non-functional features are usually part of the Definition of Done and should be considered for every Product Backlog item and every Increment. Sometimes, some non-functional features that address a very particular part of the software can be added as separate items in the Product Backlog. All Sprints are the same. There's no Sprint zero, hardening Sprint, release Sprint, integration Sprint, etc.



Question 19:

Developers are free to change their engineering and testing practices whenever they want. Choose only ONE best answer.

False
True


Answer: B.



Explanation

Developers decide how to handle their development, and this decision can evolve during the project, as more is learned about the needs. This is about their development and doesn't have to be constrained by the Sprints. The elements that shouldn't be changed during the Sprint are those required for keeping them focused on their development.



Question 20:

From the following answers, choose one which is not a prioritization technique?

Choose only ONE best answer.

Kano analysis
Product Backlog ordering
Planning Poker
User Story Mapping


Answer: C.



Explanation

Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate the effort or relative size of development goals in software development. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by placing numbered cards face-down on the table, instead of saying them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates. Planning Poker is not a prioritization technique



Question 21:

True or False. After Scrum implementation, the Scrum Team ensures the exception of technical debt.

False
True


Answer: A.



Explanation

Scrum cannot ensure the exception of technical debt.

Question 24:

True or False. Scrum is a software development methodology.

Choose only ONE best answer.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage work on complex products since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process, technique, or definitive method. Rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and work techniques so that you can continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment.

The Team may decrease the technical debt by _________________.

Choose only one best answer.

Hiring an external auditor
Improving the definition of ‘tone”
Having hardening Sprints
Hiring more Developers


Answer: B.



Explanation

There’s usually room for improving the definition of “Done”. A good definition will let less technical debt pass on to the next Sprints. Technical debt is minor shortcomings in the code

that makes it less than “good enough”, and therefore creates risks in the future. It usually

decreases velocity in the future (because the team has to fix the shortcomings), and as some

if the debt might remain in the final product, the maintenance cost will increase as well.

Another Agile way of reducing technical debt is continuous refactoring.



Question 28:

The benefits of having a solid product vision are:

Choose all answers that apply.

It gives an overall direction to the Sprints
It helps identify the best time for releasing the product
It’s a traditional concept and there are no benefits for it
It makes it easier to inspect the incremental progress of  the product
It helps the team stay focused and make better decisions


Answer: A, D, E.



Explanation

Product vision is not explained in the Scrum Guide and is not a mandatory part of the framework. However, it’s recommended to have one, and use it to help align the decisions and development with the expected outcome of the project



Question 29:

From the following answers choose one. In Scrum, by transparency we mean ___________

Choose only one best answer.

The process should be visible and understood by each stakeholder
The whole process should be visible to the Product Owner
Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work
The whole process should be visible to stakeholders.


Answer: C.



Explanation

Transparency is about visibility and doesn’t contain understanding; even though we’d better try our best to create the right understanding too, but that’s another story. The “whole process” might be too much for some stakeholders; “significant aspects” is enough, as we treat most things in Agile environments.



Question 30:

Which of the following is correct about the Scrum Team?

All answers apply.
The Scrum Team engages the stakeholders.
Is responsible for maximizing the value of the product.
The Scrum Team is responsible for measuring the performance of the project.
None of the answers apply.
The Scrum Team is cross-functional.


Answer: F.



Explanation

The whole Scrum Team is self-managed and cross-functional, as stated in the Scrum Guide. The Product Owners measure the performance of the project to maximize the value of the product that is developed.



Question 31:

Who creates a Sprint Goal?

Scrum Master
Developer
Scrum team
Product Owner


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goat also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives. The whole Scrum Team collaborates at Sprint Planning events to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.



Question 32:

How would the Product Backlog be impacted by the changes in the environment in which the product will be used? Choose only one best answer.

It evolves to reflect the changes
The Product Backlog should be kept high-level enough to tolerate such changes.
It is required to complete the old Product Backlog and create a new Product Backlog
There’s no effect on the Product Backlog.
It is required to complete the old Product Backlog and create a new Product
            Backlog



Answer: A.



Explanation

A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it lays out the initially

known and best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and

the environment in which it will be used evolves



Question 33:

A company has three products. Which two of the following are an acceptable way of forming Scrum teams? Choose all answers that apply.

There must be one Product Owner for each product. It is not required to have one Product Owner for two and more teams.
There can be one Product Owner for each product
There can be a single Product Owner for all products
There must be a single Product Owner for all products


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

Maximum number of product owners for a team is 1. The minimum number of product owners for all scrum teams is also 1.



Question 34:

True or False. According to the new version of the Scrum Guide, Scrum Teams are self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how. It means that Scrum Teams are not self- organizing.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Self-management is the minimum bar. Scrum Teams can still be self-organizing, self- designing, or even self-governing if the situation allows, and supporting such constructs can provide immense benefit. Remember, Scrum is a framework. It gives the scaffolding for people, teams, and organizations to generate value through adaptive solutions to complex problems. The Scrum Guide only states what is required for Scrum, and ideally, nothing else.



Question 35:

Which Scrum event or artifact supports daily inspection and adaptation? Choose only one best answer.

Sprint Backlog
Daily Scrum
Sprint
Product Backlog


Answer: B.



Explanation

There is only one daily activity (event) is scrum: Daily Scrum



Question 36:

The Increment is the summation of overall backlog items finished during the Sprint and also the previous completed Sprints. But when should the Increment be shipped? Choose only one best answer.

When it makes sense
After each Sprint
When the Increment is free of defects
When the Increment is shippable


Answer: A.



Explanation

All Increments should be potentially releasable (shippable), but we don't have to release all of them. It depends on the project environment and the customer, and the Product Owner is supposed to decide on it



Question 37:

Technical debt leads to ______________. Choose only one best answer.

Projects that are over-budget
Products that are difficult to extend and maintain
Processes that lack tools
Nowhere


Answer: B.



Explanation

Technical debt refers to quality consequences by the poor technical choices made



Question 38:

What does the Burn-down Chart show? Choose only one best answer.

The evolution of the amount of uncertainty during a project
How much work remains until the end of the Sprint
Dependencies, start times and stop times for project tasks
An overview of the release progress by plotting the remaining workload


Answer: B.



Explanation

The burn-down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. That is, it is a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed. However burn-down charts are not mandatory in Scrum



Question 39:

What is unrealized value in Scrum? Choose only ONE best answer.

The organization's ability to quickly deliver new capabilities, services, or products
The value that the product delivers
The potential future value that could be realized if the organization met the needs of all potential customers or users.
All of the above.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The potential future value that could be realized if the organization met the needs of all potential customers or users. Looking at Unrealized Value helps an organization to maximize the value that it realizes from a product or service over time. When customers, users, or clients experience a gap between their current experience and the experience that they would like to have, the difference between the two represents an opportunity; this opportunity is measured by Unrealized Value.



Question 40:

Some of the Sprint Backlog items were not completed and some were completed during the Sprint. What should happen with completed items when the Sprint is canceled? Choose only one best answer.

Such items will be reviewed, and if they are potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts them.
Such items should be moved back to the Product Backlog and would be taken care of in future Sprints.
Such items should be moved to the next Sprint Backlog.


Answer: A.



Explanation

When a Sprint is canceled, any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed. if part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog. The work done on them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated.



Question 41:

From the following statements choose one or more correct answers about the Daily Scrum. Choose all answers that apply.

The Daily Scrum is time-boxed
Only Developers participate at this event
The Product Owner must provide updates to Developers at the Daily Scrum
The Scrum Master makes a report to the Product Owner


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for Developers. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At this event, Developers plan activities for the next 24 hours.



Question 42:

What should the Product Owner do during the Sprint zero? Choose only one best answer.

There’s no such event in Scrum as Sprint Zero

Question 43:

Which of the following are ways for stakeholders to interact with Developers? (select all correct answers)

At the Sprint Planning
Via the Product Owner
At the Sprint Review
At the Daily Scrums
At the Sprint Retrospective


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item's priority must address the Product Owner. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.



Question 44:

A new Increment of working software must be available __________________

Choose only one best answer.

Before each planned release
At the end of each Sprint
Every 3 Sprints
Whenever the user acceptance testing is done
When the Product Owner asks for it


Answer: B.



Explanation

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in usable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of "Done".



Question 45:

How much of the Sprint Backlog should be defined during the Sprint Planning meeting?

Choose only one best answer.

Just enough, so Developers can forecast what it can do, and start the first several days of the Sprint.
Just enough to understand design and architecture.
During the Sprint Planning event, the Scrum Team selects all of the potential work
Just enough for the Scrum Master to be able to assign tasks to Developers The Product Owner decides it


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Sprint Backlog includes the items selected from the Product Backlog and the tasks created by decomposing the items. The items are completely planned in the Sprint Planning, but not all tasks are created; just enough for the first few days of development. The rest of the tasks will be created during the Sprint



Question 46:

True or False. Each Developer in the Scrum Team must be cross-functional.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

According to the Scrum Guide, Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value for each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how. It means they must be cross-functional as a team, but not individually

Question 50:

Which of the following is the single source of requirements for all changes to the product? Choose only one best answer.

The Increment
The Sprint Retrospective
The Product Backlog
The Sprint Backlog
The product vision


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.



Question 51:

Question 53:

What are good ways for a Scrum Team to ensure security concerns are satisfied? Select all correct answers.

Add a Sprint to specifically resolve all security concerns
Postpone the work until a specialist can perform a security audit and create a list of security-related Product Backlog items
Delegate the work to the concerned department
Add security concerns to the definition of “Done”
Have the Scrum Team create Product Backlog items for each concern.


Answer: D, E.



Explanation

Many of the security concerns are non-functional features and therefore will be added to the Definition of Done to be applied to all Product Backlog items. Some security concerns are specific and only about a certain part of the product and they can be items in the Product Backlog.



Question 54:

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment in each Sprint. Which of the following answers are the responsibilities of Developers in Scrum? Choose all answers that apply.

Pulling Product Backlog items for the upcoming Sprint
Creating new Product Backlog items
Estimating Sprint Backlog items
Creating tasks for Sprint Backlog items
Reordering the Product Backlog


Answer: A, C, D.

Question 57:

Representatives from the Scrum Teams meet once again to discuss common issues identified in the Scrum Team Retrospectives. They agree on how to visualize and track the identified actions that will enable Scaled Scrum to learn and adapt as a whole. What part of the Scaled Scrum Sprint Retrospective is it?

Choose only one best answer.

1
2
3
The process doesn’t relate to the Scaled Scrum Sprint Retrospective


Answer: D.



Explanation

There are no mandatory requirements for teams in Scaled Scrum to divide Sprint Retrospective events into 2 or more parts. It is up to the Scaled Scrum Integration Team



Question 58:

What is the maximum number of members in the Scaled Scrum Integration Team?

Choose only one best answer.

3 to 9
15
5 to 11
As many as required to develop and integrate the best solution for the product

Explanation

There is a single Product Backlog for the entire Scaled Scrum and all of its Scrum Teams. The Product Owner is accountable for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.



Question 60:

Transitioning from Waterfall to Scrum is a very significant step for the organization. How will the organization measure the success of Scrum implementation? Choose all answers that apply.

By reducing costs
By increasing customer satisfaction
By delivering an increment every Sprint
Through frequent releases and meeting value metrics or KPIs
By releasing new features after each Sprint


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

Customer and end user's satisfaction is important. It's not an abstract measure like lines of code or velocity. There can be some KPIs for measuring the value of the releases, and when improved, will show our success. Increased velocity is desired, but it's not directly connected to value and can be misleading. That's the same with production cost. It's mandatory to deliver an Increment every Sprint.



Question 61:

As a Product Owner, you are responsible for stakeholder management. From the following answers choose the correct statement about the relationship between PO and the stakeholder.

Choose only one best answer.

The stakeholder is a manager of the Product Owner and he or she creates task for the Product Backlog
Stakeholders are always users of the product and they can’t advise anything to the PO
The Product Owner represents the stakeholders to the Scrum Team, which includes representing their desired requirements in the Product Backlog
One of the stakeholders must be the Scrum Master


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Product Owner is the bridge between the team and the stakeholders. The Product Owner actively asks for stakeholder expectations to process into the Product Backlog.



Question 62:

Every Scrum team must determine its own cadence for releasing features to customers. Some choose to release every sprint, while others after 2, 3 and even more Sprints. But who is responsible for planning releases? Choose only one best answer.

Developers
Scrum Master
Product Owner
Project manager


Answer: C.



Explanation

Release Planning is the Responsibility of the Product Owner.



Question 63:

True or False. The Product Owner ensures enough items are selected from the Product Backlog in the Sprint Planning meeting to satisfy the stakeholders.

False
True


Answer: A.



Explanation

It's only up to the developers to decide how many items they will select from the top of the Product Backlog. The Product Owner only orders the items.



Question 64:

The Product Owner decides not to create a Product Goal. In this case (select all correct answers).

It is up to the Product Owner
Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless
The Scrum Master is helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
The Product Owner must discuss with Developers and if they are ok with it, then he or she may remove the Product Goal


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

As we know from the Scrum Guide while implementing only parts of Scrum is possible (by removing the Product Goal), the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices. In this case, the best action from the Scrum Master to discuss it with the Product Owner and find techniques for effective Product Goal definition



Question 65:

Who is the chief product visionary? Choose only one best answer.

The Scrum Master
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
The Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)
The Product Owner
The manager of the team


Answer: D.



Explanation

One of the product owner's responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or she wishes to build and convey that vision to the scrum team. This is key to successfully starting any agile software development



Question 66:

Who creates the Sprint Goal? Choose only one best answer.

The Scrum Master
Developers
The Scrum Team
The Product Owner


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives. The whole Scrum Team collaborates at Sprint Planning events to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.



Question 67:

During the Daily Scrum, a team member says he does not know when his task will be complete (choose the best option)

It is acceptable as the sprint review date is far away.
Replace the team member with a new team member.
Developers should collaborate to plan alternative steps such as pairing with someone else, etc to eliminate the  risk of not meeting the Sprint Goal.
Scrum Master should mentor the team member on how to test. the task


Answer: C.



Explanation

Scrum Teams are self-managing and cross-functional. Self-managing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. So the dev team should collaborate to plan alternative steps such as pairing with someone else, etc. to eliminate the risk of not meeting the Sprint Goal.



Question 68:

In the middle of the Sprint, Developers find that they have more room for additional work. They decided to change the Sprint Backlog by adding a few more backlog items from the Product Backlog. Who should be present to decide the additional work and accordingly modify the Sprint Backlog? (choose the best two options)



Senior members of developers.
Scrum Master.
Developers.
Product Owner.
Scrum Team


Answer: C, D.



Explanation

Nobody can change the Sprint Backlog other than developers. So Developers should be present. Product Owner is responsible for optimizing the value of developers' work and is needed to explain the content of the Product Backlog, and give mutual consent on the next work. Product Owner is accountable for Product Backlog and prioritizing product backlog items. So the Product Owner also needs to be present.



Question 69:

The Product Owner should communicate all of the marketplace knowledge & ever-changing landscape/environment to the Scrum Team. Who should do the preliminary work of gathering the marketplace data for the Product Owner? (choose the best option).

The Scrum  Master.
It does not matter who does the preliminary work.
The Key Stakeholders.
The Product Owner.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner may or may not be the one doing the legwork of gathering the marketplace data, he/she may delegate the responsibility to others but the Product Owner should definitely be aware of said data/research.



Question 70:

What is "Progressive Elaboration"? (choose the best option)

In the pre-project stage. it is the act of working to understand requirements of the product
The act of waiting for details to randomly emerge and completing the tasks once that occurs.
Shu-Ha-Ri is in the Shu stage when one is just beginning to learn something new; over time they progressively learn and understand more.
As the project progresses, details will emerge in greater and greater clarity until they are able to be understood to a sufficient level to complete the needed work.


Answer: D.



Explanation

As the project progresses, details will emerge in greater and greater clarity until they are able to be understood to a sufficient level to complete the needed work



Question 71:

Which statement can be considered an Increment? (choose the best option)

A UML diagram that describes the functionalities in the future Sprints.
A user interface layout designed for the software.
The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during the Sprint and the value of the increments of all  previous Sprints.
The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during the Sprint


Answer: C.



Explanation

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.



The user interface layout/UML diagram evolves throughout the project, as the database architecture and other similar things. They are all part of functional features, rather than separate ones. The increment is current and additive to all prior Increments.



Question 72:

Non-functional requirements of the product such as performance, security, etc., can be captured by:

(choose the best two options)

Writing a separate document capturing the requirements and adding as appendix to Product Backlog.
Adding them to the Product Backlog with Product Owners  consent and collaborating to estimate and order them.
Adding them to the Definition of “Done” and making the  Product Owner aware of them.
Waiting until the decision of the Product Owner to release the Increment. Then, build the non-functional requirements for stabilization.


Answer: B, C



Explanation

Adding them to Product Backlog with Product Owner's consent and collaborating to estimate and order them & Adding them to Definition of "Done" and make the Product Owner aware of them.



Question 73:

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. Which of the following statements are related to Product Backlog Refinement. (choose all options that apply).

It guides the team on how & what work needs be to delivered to build a potentially shippable Increment
It is an ongoing process.
Is time-boxed to a maximum of 4 hours for a 30 days sprint
It adds details, estimates, and order as per product Owner prioritization to Product Backlog items.
The Product Owner may delegate this responsibility to others but he/she still remains accountable.
It provides a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.


Answer: B, D, E.



Explanation

Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Developers collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. It includes:

●      Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;

●      Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;

●      Ordering Product Backlog items; and,

●      Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and understood.



The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.



Question 74:

What are the important characteristics of a good Product Backlog item which can be considered as "Ready" for Sprint Planning? (choose all options that apply).

Product Backlog items which are sufficiently refined & clearly expressed.
Product Backlog item which can be developed within one Sprint even if tested in another Sprint.
Product Backlog item which will be finished as per Definition of Done within one Sprint
Product Backlog items which are at or towards the bottom of the Product Backlog.
Product Backlog item which is at the top of the  Product Backlog.


Answer: A, C, E.



Explanation

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

Product Backlog items that will occupy developers for the upcoming Sprint are sufficiently refined so that any one item can reasonably be "Done" within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be "Done" by developers within one Sprint are deemed "Ready" for selection in a Sprint Planning.



Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail.



Rest two options are incorrect as Product Backlog items that are at or towards the bottom of the Product Backlog are not clear enough to pick up in a sprint. Development & testing of the product is considered in the same sprint as the team has to deliver a working & usable increment which complies with Definition of Done. Without testing, the team can't consider an increment as done.



Question 75:

Which statement best describes a Product Owner's responsibility? (choose the best answer)

Keep stakeholders from distracting the Developers.
Optimizing the value of the work the Scrum Team does.
Managing the project and ensuring that the work meets the commitments to the stakeholders.
Directing the Developers.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Scrum Team.



Question 76:

When many Scrum Teams are working on a single product, what best describes the Definition of Done? (choose the best answer)

It depends.
Each Scrum Team uses its own, but must make their definition clear to all other teams so the differences are known.
All Scrum Teams must have a Definition of Done that makes their combined Increment valuable and useful.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Increment must be valuable and useful. This means that when many Scrum Teams are working on a single product, they are expected to adhere to a single Definition of Done for the Increment.



Question 77:

The Developers should not be interrupted during the Sprint and the Sprint Goal should remain intact. These are conditions that foster creativity, quality and productivity. Which one of the following answers is FALSE?

The Developers may work with the Product Owner to remove or add work if it finds it has more or less capacity than it expected.
As a decomposition of the selected Product Backlog items, the Sprint Backlog changes and may grow as the work emerges.
The Sprint Backlog is fully formulated in the Sprint  Planning event and does not change during the Sprint
The Product Owner can help clarify or optimize the Sprint when asked by the Developers.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Developers identify as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal. The Developers modify the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.



Question 78:

When does a Developer become the sole owner of an item or task on the Sprint Backlog?

(choose the best answer)

Whenever a team member can accommodate more work.
During the Daily Scrum.
At the Sprint Planning event.
Never. All Sprint Backlog items are “owned” by the Developers on the Scrum Team.


Answer: D.



Explanation

The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint, and the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint are collectively owned by the Developers. No individual Developer can claim ownership over an item as this would block communication and collaboration. The Sprint Backlog is updated by the Developers throughout the Sprint as more is learned.



Question 79:

A Scrum Team consists of the following:

(choose the best three answers)

Customers
Developers
Users
Scrum Master
Product Owner


Answer: B, D, E.



Explanation

The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner. and Developers.



Question 80:

Who should know the most about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and be able to explain the alternatives most clearly? (choose the best answer)

The Developers
The Product Owner
The Scrum Master
The Project Manager


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for ordering the Product Backlog. Their responsibilities include making the Product Backlog visible, transparent, and clear to all.

Question 1:

Which of the following statements best describes transparency?

The process should be visible, and understood by key stakeholders.
Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
The whole process should be visible to stakeholders.
The whole process should be visible to everyone.


Answer: B.



Explanation

Significant aspects means not all the details. Process means the way we work. Those responsible for the outcome means not all people in the world.



Question 2:

True or False. Velocity of Scrum Teams should be normalized, so that management can measure and compare their performance.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Progress measurements are done internally, not by external managers. Also, comparing the velocity dependent on estimates of two different teams is never reliable, and it's not productive even if it were reliable. Different Scrum Teams can point differently.



Question 3:

How does the Product Owner determine the number of items for the Sprint Backlog?

They don’t do it
Based on velocity
In a way that maximizes the value of the Increment
Based on a combination of velocity and team capacity


Answer: A.



Explanation

It's only up to the self-managing Developers to decide how many items they will select for the Sprint Backlog.



Question 4:

Which of the following are pillars of Scrum?

Sustainable pace
Value optimization
Adaptation
Transparency
Inspection


Answer: C, D, E.



Explanation

Pillars are transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Make sure you're not confusing these pillars with the Scrum values (commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect).



Question 5:

Which of the following is the least productive way for the Scrum Master to improve the Developers' communications with the Product Owner?

Teach them how to effectively communicate.
Monitor their communication performance.
Suggest effective communication tools and techniques to the Product Owner.
Act as a go-between for them.


Answer: D.



Explanation

Acting as a proxy doesn't work at all. Teaching and monitoring the communication is the right way to fix the problem. Make sure you have noticed the word "least".



Question 6:

True or False. The whole Sprint Backlog is defined in the Sprint Planning meeting.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

There are two elements in the Sprint Backlog: items selected from the Product Backlog and tasks created by decomposing those items. Sprint Backlog items could change as more is learnt, so it could change from the Developers.



Question 7:

True or False. Sprint Review is an informal meeting.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Scrum Guide states the word "formal" in two different ways. First, all events are "formal opportunities" for inspecting and adapting, which basically means a serious opportunity. So, if the question is "... is a formal opportunity for...", it would be a correct statement. The second usage is "formal meeting", which means a meeting where people approve something and exchange signatures. In that sense, none of the events are formal meetings. In the Sprint Review meeting, for example, the goal is creating feedback and adapting, not contract negotiations and exchanging signatures. So, if the statement is "... is a formal meeting", then it would be an incorrect statement. The Scrum Guide states: "Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum."



Question 8:

True or False. It's required to use User Stories in Scrum.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

It's a good idea to use User Stories to form the Product Backlog items, but it's not mandatory in Scrum.



Question 9:

Which of the following statements best describes the Sprint Review event?

A demo at the end of the Sprint for everyone in the organization to see the Increment.
It’s a controlling mechanism for evaluating the work of Developers.
It’s a celebration at the end of the Sprint to appreciate the work of Developers.
An inspection of the Increment to collect feedback and see what to do in the next Sprint


Answer: D.



Explanation

As stated in the Scrum Guide the purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.



Question 10:

True or False. The Scrum Master could never order the Product Backlog items.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner may order the Product Backlog or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.



Question 11:

True or False. A Scrum Team's velocity was 250 at the end of the 6th Sprint. It became 275 at the end of the 8th Sprint. Therefore, they are creating more value now compared to before.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

There's no direct relationship between velocity and value, maybe they're working faster on less valuable items, in which case, velocity will be higher, but value may be the same, higher, or lower. Many people consider velocity as the most important criterion, but that's not true -- they should rather be focused on value, Sprint Goal, and Product Goal.



Question 12:

Which of the following are required by Scrum?

Definition of Ready
Having timeboxed events
User Stories
Scrum Events
Test-Driven Development
Definition of Done


Answer: B, D, F.



Explanation

There are no Definition of Ready, TDD or User Stories in Scrum, they can be used, but they are not mandatory.



Question 13:

True or False. Each Increment must be released.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Each Increment must be potentially releasable, but you don't have to release them.



Question 14:

True or False. The Scrum Team should have a Team Leader to improve communications and collaboration.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

It's not allowed to introduce new accountabilities or titles such as "Team Leader" in Scrum.



Question 15:

True or False. Adding new Developers to the team may cause a short-term decrease in productivity.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

When more Developers are added to the team, there's usually a short-term decrease in productivity because other members have to spend time and effort familiarizing the new members with the development environment of the project. After a while, the existence of new members may increase productivity, but even if it does, it's usually not a linear increase because, for example, having more people increases communication channels, which consumes some of the capacity.



Question 16:

Harry is a Scrum Master of a new Scrum Team with six Developers. He is trying to make sure that all the accountabilities are understood by the Scrum Team. Which of the following statements are correct about the Developers? (Select the best two answers)

They prioritize tasks in the Sprint Backlog
They participate in the Daily Serum meeting
Thay are responsible for engaging the stakeholders
They prioritize the Product Backlog items
They cause the removal of impediments


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

The Product Owner is responsible for engaging the stakeholders. Developers are responsible for the Sprint Backlog and they must participate in Daily Scrum, others can attend as listeners. Removing impediments happens from everyone not only the Developers and they are all coached from the Scrum Master on how to do it. The Product Owner is the one who orders the items in the Product Backlog.



Question 17:

True or False. All teams should be cross-functional in scaled Scrum.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

It's one of the basic concepts in Scrum to have cross-functional, self-managing teams.



Question 18:

Three Scrum Teams are currently building a single product and pulling work from the same Product Backlog. All three teams have identified that they will need Dmytro, a database specialist, to work full time in their team for the next several Sprints. What should Steven, the Scrum Master, do to solve this potential problem?

Ask Dmytro to work with the HR department to recruit and hire additional database specialists. In the meantime, have the Product Owner move items that do not depend on Dmytro to the top of the Product Backlog.
Coach the Scrum Teams to self-manage this issue and help them implement their preferred solution.
Assign Dmytro to the team with the most urgent tasks first and then move him to the next team and so on until the required support is completed.
Manage the items in the Sprint Backlogs so that Dmytro can be utilized evenly for each team.


Answer: B.



Explanation

If requested, the Scrum Master can even facilitate conversations through open ended questions in order to help the team members make the best possible decisions according to what is known at the time. He/she does not approve or reject team decisions but ensures the team stays within the boundaries of the Scrum framework.



Question 19:

Who's responsible for quality?

Team Leaders
Developers.
Testers


Answer: B.



Explanation

There are no Testers or Team Leaders in Scrum. There are only Developers, because we don't have extra accountabilities and titles in Scrum. However, there can be Developers who are experts in testing. Remember that everyone is called a Developer.



Question 20:

At the end of the Sprint, all items are done except for one that is almost done. What should be done with this item?

Put it in the next Sprint Backlog.
The Sprint will be extended until we complete the item.
It can be added to the Increment if the user acceptance tests are done.
Move it back to the Product Backlog.
It should not be included in the Increment.


Answer: D, E.



Explanation

It shouldn't be moved to the next Sprint Backlog. It has to go to the Product Backlog and let the Product Owner decide what is going to happen. If the item is still at the top, it will be selected in the next Sprint Planning meeting. The Increment contains only items that meet the DoD. Sprints are timeboxed, meaning that we don't extend their duration.



Question 21:

Which of the following statements are misleading about non-functional requirements? (Select the best three answers)

Some of them can be added to the Definition of Done.
They will be in the Sprint Backlog, but not the Product Backlog.
They will be reflected in the Sprint Goal.
Scrum is all about functional requirements.
They should be incorporated into every Increment.
Some of them can be added to the Product Backlog or as per Acceptance Criteria of Product Backlog items.


Answer: B, C, D.



Explanation

Non-functional features are about the way functional features work, not about the goals for Sprints. All items in the Sprint Backlog come from the Product Backlog, except for process improvement items (if the team decides it) that are generated in Sprint Retrospectives. There are non-functional requirements like security, scalability, maintainability, performance.



Question 22:

Which of the following statements best describe the Product Backlog? (Select the best three answers)

It’s used to create the project plan.
The Product Owner is accountable for it.
It may change anytime, and it is never complete.
It changes as we learn more about the project.
Provides just enough information to enable the Developers to design the whole product.


Answer: B, C, D.



Explanation

It describes everything that is needed in the product. There's no "project plan" in Scrum. Product Backlog is the closest thing to a project plan that we have in Scrum.



Question 23:

An organization has just hired you as a new Scrum Master to help them transform their teams from their current traditional process to Scrum. The teams are currently structured to specialize in a single function, which is also known as component teams where a team would only address a single layer (i.e. front-end, back-end, testing, etc.). You’ve introduced the concept of cross-functional teams where all the skills needed to produce business functionality, from end to end, are inside of a single team. What should you keep in mind when transitioning from siloed teams to cross-functional teams? (Select the best two answers)

It is easier to compare the performance between cross-functional teams in order to identify which teams to assign tasks to and which teams need additional coaching.
Without feature teams, you cannot do Scrum. Postpone Scrum adoption until the teams are reorganized in feature teams.
People from the different layers and components will need time to become accustomed to working and delivering unified functionality together as one Scrum Team thus productivity may suffer.
Newly formed teams will need time to stabilize before reaching their peak performance. During the initial stages of forming, performance will suffer and productivity may be low, although even then delivery of business value is still likely to increase.


Answer: C, D.



Explanation

Forming a team takes time, and members often go through recognizable stages as they change from being a group of individuals to a team with common goals. Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing model describes these stages by Bruce Tuckman. When you understand it, you can help your new team become effective more quickly.



Question 24:

What do we do with Done items when the Sprint is canceled?

They should be moved back to the Product Backlog, and will be taken care of in future Sprints.
They should be moved to the next Sprint Backlog.
They will be reviewed, and if they are potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts them.


Answer: C.



Explanation

They are Done, so we shouldn't move them back to the Product Backlog? Items in the Sprint Backlog come from the Product Backlog. So, if it's supposed to be done, we will move them back to the Product Backlog, and if they are still on the top of the Product Backlog, they will be picked for the next Sprint. However, this question is about items that are Done, and there's no reason to move them back.



Question 25:

According to Scrum Theory, how should a group of fifty Developers be divided into multiple teams?

Allow the team leads to divide and select teams.
Understanding the product, the product vision and the Scrum framework, the group self-manages into teams.
The teams will rotate members every Sprint to spread knowledge.
Create a skills matrix, identify their levels, and years of experience to assign people to teams.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Scrum Team needs to be self-managing. The Scrum Master should coach them when needed or requested.



Question 26:

Who owns the Product Backlog?

The Developers
The whole Scrum Team
The Product Owner
The Serum Master


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Product Owner is accountable for it, as stated in the Scrum Guide: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management"



Question 27:

How do changes in the project environment impact the Product Backlog?

The Product Backlog should be kept high-level enough to tolerate such changes.
It evolves to reflect the changes (Correct)
The old baselined Product Backlog would be saved, and a new one would be created for the rest of the project.
There’s no effect on the Product Backlog.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Backlog is not baselined. New changes should be investigated and create new items that cover it and maybe also change some of the existing items. The Product Backlog has "just enough" details, but it's not so high-level that it can tolerate all changes.



Question 28:

Which of the following are feedback loops in Scrum?

Release Planning
Sprint Review
Burn-down chart
Sprint Planning


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

Releases are also feedback loops, but release planning has feedback elements in it, however, none of these are formal events in Scrum. This is an optional concept, and may facilitate the generation of some types of feedback, but it's not a "feedback loop". Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective are "formal opportunities for inspecting and adapting", and are considered to be "feedback loops". Note that being a "formal opportunity" doesn't mean that any signatures will be exchanged in those events, nor anything else that may turn them into "gates". The main purpose is to enable adaptation.



Question 29:

Which statement is correct about the Product Backlog?

It has all the details.
It has just enough details.
It has no details.


Answer: B.



Explanation

Both Sprint Backlog and Product Backlog evolve during their lives, and the amount of information grows as time passes. So, at each point in time, they don't have as much detail as they will probably have in the future. On the other hand, we never add all the details there. For example, it's common to say that a User Story doesn't provide all the information, but is an excuse for the people involved in the project to have communications around a certain topic. The details are in those communications and are not completely captured in the backlog.



Question 30:

Which of the following statements is correct about the Developers?

None of the answers apply
They order the Product Backlog items
They participate in the Daily Scrum meeting
They are responsible for measuring the performance of the project
They decide when to release the product


Answer: C.



Explanation

Releasing the product, measuring the performance of the project and ordering the Product Backlog are the Product Owner's responsibility. Developers must participate in Daily Scrum. Others can attend as listeners.



Question 31:

The Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that the _____ identify/identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal.

Scrum Master
Scrum Team
Product Owner
Developers


Answer: D.



Explanation

Developers are accountable for the Sprint Backlog and Sprint Goal is their commitment.



Question 32:

What's the main reason for the Product Owner to be at the Daily Scrum?

To assign tasks to Developers.
To track changes to the Sprint Backlog.
To tell Developers what to do.
It’s not necessary for them to be in the meeting.
To order the Sprint Backlog


Answer: D.



Explanation

Developers are self-managed and take care of their commitment.In general, Daily Scrum is for the Developers, which means that the Developers must participate. Others can attend as listeners. The Product Owner can attend if necessary to answer questions.



Question 33:

Which of those statements are misleading about Scrum?

Scrum is like traditional processes but with self-management to replace Project Managers.
Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products.
Scrum is a methodology where you can pick and choose which parts of Scrum you think will work for your environment.
Scrum is based on empirical process control theory.
Scrum is a framework that eliminates complexity.
Each component of Scrum serves a specific purpose and is essential to your ability to use Scrum to develop complex products.


Answer: A, C, E.



Explanation

Scrum is meant to be implemented as prescribed in the Scrum Guide, the five Scrum Events are mandatory and each one has a specific purpose. Scrum does not eliminate the complexity that is inherent in delivering a product in today’s world, instead it offers a framework for dealing with complexity. By regularly delivering Increments of value teams gain the ability to inspect and rapidly adapt based on the feedback received. Project Managers are not simply replaced by self-managing teams. Scrum is a framework for optimizing decision making based on the knowledge and experience of the entire team.



Question 34:

When does a customer cancel a Sprint?

When the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
The customer doesn’t have the authority to cancel the Sprint.
When not enough information is available for the items in the Sprint Backlog
When not enough resources are available for the project


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint. The customer isn't allowed to do so.



Question 35:

How many members are there in a Scrum Team?

Typically 10 or fewer
3 to 12
5 to 12
3 to 9
2 to 8


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive.



Question 36:

An organization is using Scrum to build five new products. What would be the best options for the number of Product Owners the organization should have? (Select the best two answers)

There is one Product Owner responsible for all five products. In order to scale his/her accountability, he/she can delegate some of the individual Product Owner responsibilities to others within each product but would still remain accountable for the value of the work produced.
Enough Product Owners to delegate as much work needed to maximize utilization of all Developers.
There is one Product Owner responsible for all five products. This person is not allowed to delegate any of the Product Owner responsibilities as he/she is accountable for the success of each product.
There is one Product Owner for each product. Each Product Owner may delegate, share and align work within their individual Product Backlog.


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for maximizing the value of the product through the ordering and management of the Product Backlog. This reduces complexity in communication and understanding who to go to when there are questions about the product. The Product Owner may delegate his/her responsibilities but still remains accountable for the outcome of those responsibilities.



Question 37:

In Scrum, how would budgeting and financial forecasting be performed? (Select the best two answers)

Budgeting is not necessary as the only funding necessary is the operational costs of the Scrum Teams.
A single release may be funded with several Sprints where every Sprint is producing shippable Increments.
Frequently inspect the outcomes of the delivered Sprint Increments to understand how much value is being produced per investment spent.
Fixed budgets are not allowed in Scrum.


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

The cost of developing, delivering, and sustaining products can impact how the flow of value is managed throughout the life of a product. Each Sprint is an opportunity to inspect the investment (financial, time, effort, etc.) against the returned value (customer satisfaction, revenue, etc.) of the work that has been delivered. The team can then decide on what it should do next to maximize the value of the investment.



Question 38:

What's the role of a Scrum Master during Sprint Retrospectives?

Participating as a Scrum Team member
Summarizing and report the results of the meeting to stakeholders
Capturing process improvement ideas for the next Sprint Backlog
They should not participate in this meeting


Answer: A.



Explanation

The whole Scrum Team participates in the Sprint Retrospective, and they work together to see how they can improve the way they work in the next Sprint.



Question 39:

True or False. The Scrum Master can also be the Product Owner.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

According to Scrum Guide, one person can have more than one accountabilities. It's not recommended, but it's not forbidden either. They don't forbid it because some of the small projects may need to use a few people to do multiple things. When doing that, the person must make sure that they are paying attention to all responsibilities that they have for each role, which is not easy.



Question 40:

Which of the following contribute the most to the Scrum value "focus"? (Select the best three answers)

Product Backlog refinement
Product Goal
Timeboxing
Sprint Review
Sprint Goal


Answer: B, C, E.



Explanation

Helps you focus on the outcome that is expected from the Sprint. Helps you focus on the most valuable aspects of items selected for the Sprint, rather than making those items fancies, because time is not unlimited. Scrum values are commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect.



Question 41:

What's the role of a Project Management Office (PMO) in an organization that only uses Scrum for project delivery?

There’s no place for a PMO in such an organization.
Manages portfolios and programs and facilitates the application
of techniques that complement Scrum.
The PMO should manage and help Scrum Masters.
The PMO should manage and help Product Owners.


Answer: B.



Explanation

There are limits to the self-management of the team, and the important thing is to have the power within the borders of the project. However, each project is run in a wider organization with multiple levels of management impacting the project, and it's not possible or even acceptable to reject that structure, as long as it doesn't block the internal self-management of the team and the fundamental adaptive approach of the project.



Question 42:

How many hours per day should a Developer work?

Depends on the Product Owners pressure from stakeholders
At a constant pace
At least 6 ideal man-hours
As much as needed for realizing the Sprint Backlog items by the end of the Sprint
Normally, 40 hours a week


Answer: B.



Explanation

This is one of the Agile principles. The Sprint Backlog is just a rough estimate of what we can do. We will have a constant pace and deliver as much as we can, within the defined quality, and nothing bad happens if all items are not delivered.



Question 43:

What happens between two Sprints?

Refactoring the previous Increment
Product Backlog refinement
Nothing
Getting customer approval for the previous Increment


Answer: C.



Explanation

Sprints are happening continuously. Refactoring is done during the Sprints. Each Sprint starts immediately after the previous one, there's no space between the two.



Question 44:

Which of the following statements are misleading about the length of Sprints? (Select the best two answers)

Sprint length is set during Sprint Planning, and is long enough to develop all items in the Sprint Backlog.
Sprint length is set during Sprint Planning, and is long enough for programming and testing all items, but not for integrating them.
It’s preferred to have Sprints with the same length.
The longer the Sprint the higher the risk
All Sprints must be one month or less.


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

One month is the maximum timeboxed duration for Sprints in Scrum. We can't change the timeboxed duration of Sprints on an ad hoc basis. The length of the Sprint has to do with the risk as well. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.



Question 45:

On average, items on the Product Backlog tend to be _______________

Smaller than those on the Sprint Backlog
Larger than those on the Sprint Backlog
The same size as those on the Sprint Backlog


Answer: B.



Explanation

Product Backlog has larger items that usually needs to be broken down into very small and clear items, because it's a form of upfront planning. Some of them may be very large. When you order the items, if they are on the top of the list, you have to make them clear, and make sure they can fit into one Sprint; therefore, you will break them down into smaller items.



Question 46:

True or False. The Product Owner is the main person responsible for engaging the stakeholders.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

Engagement of stakeholders is mostly about and around the Product Backlog items, and at least indirectly, about the value created in the project. That's why this is mainly the responsibility of the Product Owner to keep them engaged. Others may contribute as well like the Scrum Master may remove impediments related to engaging stakeholders and Developers may find ways to facilitate it. Nevertheless, the main person responsible for engaging stakeholders is the Product Owner.



Question 47:

True or False. It's up to the self-managing team to decide which Scrum artifacts are needed in the project.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Self-management is not unlimited, the Scrum Team should follow the Scrum framework.



Question 48:

During Sprint Planning, the Definition of Done will help the Scrum Team forecast the amount of work, selected from the Product Backlog, deemed feasible to meet the "Done" by the end of the Sprint. Which two items best describe what "Done" means? (Select the best two answers)

All the work needed to prepare the Increment for Integration Testing.
All the work completed within the current skills and expertise in the Scrum Team.
Having an Increment of working software that is potentially releasable to the end users.
All the work performed as defined in the Definition of Done.
All the work needed to prepare the Increment for User Acceptance Testing.


Answer: C, D.



Explanation

When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as ‘Done’, everyone must understand what ‘Done’ means. Although this may vary significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This is the Definition of Done for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current Definition of Done.



Question 49:

What's the normal timeboxed duration of Sprint Review when there are 6 Developers in the team and Sprints are two weeks long?

4 hours
2 hours
8 hours
3 hours


Answer: B.



Explanation

As stated in the Scrum Guide the timebox of Sprint Review is 4 hours in a one-month Sprint and normally shorter for shorter Sprints.



Question 50:

The timebox of this Scrum Event should be no more than four hours.

Sprint Review
Release Sprint
Sprint Retrospective
Release Planning
Sprint
Sprint Planning


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.



Question 51:

Which of the following elements are attributes of Product Backlog items?

Owner
Description
Estimate
Order


Answer: B, C, D.



Explanation

Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.



Question 52:

Which of the following is least likely to be used by a Scrum Team?

Digital camera, task board
Gantt Chart
Wiki, online forum
Large screen, Planning Poker cards


Answer: B.



Explanation

Note the word "least" in the question. WBS and Gantt Chart are mainly used in planning predictive (plan-based) projects rather than adaptive (Agile) ones.



Question 53:

Which of the following statements show the result of changing Scrum terminology while implementing it in the organization? (Select the best three answers)

They will get better results adopting Scrum this way.
The change might not be obvious to everyone, and therefore very little change actually happens.
The change might not be obvious to everyone! and some benefits may be lost.
It’s necessary to tailor Scrum to suit the project.
Management may feel less enthusiastic about the change.


Answer: B, C, E.



Explanation

Scrum is a simple framework rather than a comprehensive methodology, and it contains only the necessary minimums that you need in every project. So, instead of normal tailoring (adjusting the existing elements), you will follow everything that is described in Scrum, and suit it to your project by the practices and techniques that you add; e.g. Planning Poker, Pair-Programming, and Test-Driven Development. When it comes to the terminology, Scrum Guide believes that it's better if you don't change it.



Question 54:

Which of the following statements best describe Sprint Planning? (Select the best two answers)

What was the feedback and how should we adapt the Product Backlog?
How are we going to do what we have decided to do in the Sprint?
Who will be in the team this Sprint?
What are we going to do during the Sprint?
What went wrong in the last Sprint and what to do about it?


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

What went wrong in the last Sprint would be discussed in the previous Sprint Retrospective. Sprint Planning has to do with the work for the next Sprint and has to cover three topics, Why is this Sprint valuable? What can be Done this Sprint? and How will the chosen work get done?



Question 55:

Who can attend the Daily Scrum meeting?

Anyone
The Developers and the Product Owner
The Developers
The Developers and the Scrum Master


Answer: A.



Explanation

Daily Scrum is for the Developers who must participate. However, others can attend as listeners, there is nothing that prohibits this.



Question 56:

True or False. The Scrum Master should ask each Developer to answer the three standard questions at the Daily Scrum.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

It's a good idea to go over the three questions, but not mandatory. Also, the meeting is managed by the Developers and the Scrum Master helps only when requested or required, it's not even mandatory to be there.



Question 57:

True or False. Vicky is a Scrum Master of a 13-member Scrum Team (including her). Because of the team size it is mandatory to divide the Scrum Team.

This is false as it is not required from Scrum to divide the Scrum Team if there are more than 10 members in the Scrum Team.
This is true as the maximum size of a Scrum Team must be 10 or fewer.


Answer: A.



Explanation

The word mandatory is key here. The Scrum Guide 2020 doesn't state anywhere that it is mandatory to divide teams. It's true that smaller teams communicate better but not necessarily. As stated in the Scrum Guide the Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people.



Question 58:

What would be two boundaries, defined in Scrum, that give guidance for teams to effectively self-manage? (Select the best two answers)

Clearly defined functional teams within the Scrum Team to define handoff phases during development.
Timeboxing the events in Scrum to allow for regular inspection and adaptation creating opportunities to adjust course in any given path.
Having a mixture of different levels of skills and experience to promote domain knowledge sharing.
Creating an integrated and potentially shippable Increment by the end of each Sprint.


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

Timeboxing promotes regularity and focus for self-managed teams. Having shippable Increments allows teams to collaboratively make decisions on what needs to be done next.



Question 59:

The Product Owner is not collaborating with the Developers during the Sprint. Which of the following actions would you choose as the Scrum Master? (Select the best two answers)

Coach the Product Owner to understand why collaboration is important in Scrum and how it can affect the value of the product.
Nominate someone else as the proxy Product Owner.
Talk to the functional manager of the Product Owner.
Cancel the Sprint and start training the Product Owner.
Bring up the issue in the next Sprint Retrospective.


Answer: A, E.



Explanation

Canceling the Sprint and starting training the Product Owner is not a valid reason for canceling the Sprint, and also, only the Product Owner can cancel Sprints. Talking to the functional manager of the Product Owner is not right, it's best to resolve issues internally. There's no proxy Product Owner in Scrum.



Question 60:

According to the values of Scrum, which is the best way to create teams of developers?

Work with the leadership team to allocate members according to skills, seniority and experience to ensure that all Scrum Teams are balanced fairly.
Provide boundaries to the Developers and allow them to self manage into teams.
The Product Owner will create a skills matrix according to what is needed for the project and work with the technical leads to allocate resources to the team.
None of the above.


Answer: B.



Explanation

When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone and self- organizing teams will be enabled to choose how best to accomplish their work.



Question 61:

Which of the following statements best explain the benefits of having tests in the Definition of Done? (Select the best two answers)

Increments would be closer to potentially releasable.
It makes reporting easier for the Project Manager.
Increases transparency of the Increments.
It defines when the Increment should be released.


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

You can't release it unless you've tested the output and are sure it won't create problems in production, so if you add tests in the DoD, you will prevent issues from happening and transparency of the quality of the Increment.



Question 62:

Which of the following are timeboxed?

Sprint
Release Retrospective
Sprint Retrospective
Sprint Review
Product Backlog refinement
Sprint testing


Answer: A, C, D.



Explanation

There's no release Retrospective event in Scrum. It's done frequently, and it's not timeboxed. Testing is done continuously. The Scrum Events are timeboxed.



Question 63:

Which of the following statements best describes the Scrum Pillar of Adaptation.

None of the answers apply.
If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted.
The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.
The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.


Answer: B.



Explanation

As stated in the Scrum Guide: "If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation."



Question 64:

True or False. The Product Owner and Scrum Master are not allowed to be part of the Developers.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

According to the Scrum Guide, one person can have more than one accountabilities. It's not recommended, but it's not forbidden either. They don't forbid it because some of the small projects may need to use a few people to do multiple things, they just need to make sure that they are paying attention to all responsibilities that they have.



Question 65:

Why are Daily Scrums held at the same time and same place?

To make sure everyone has to be there
To be able to book rooms upfront
So that everyone will know where and when to find the Developers
To reduce complexity and wasted time


Answer: D.



Explanation

Consider having to spend some time every day, arranging the next Daily Scrum, it would be painful. It’s just too much waste, and it’s much easier to keep it simple and have the meetings at the same time and the same place every day.



Question 66:

Which of the following is not mandatory in Scrum?

Inspect Progress
Timeboxing the events
Sprint Planning
Story Points
Pair-Programming
Measure Velocity


Answer: D, E, F.



Explanation

Only the accountabilities, events, and artifacts are mandatory as well as the Definition of Done and progress measurement of course.



Question 67:

Which of the following is not required by Scrum?

Test-Driven Development
None of the answers apply
Definition of Done
Sprint Retrospectives
All answers apply
Having timeboxed events


Answer: A.



Explanation

TDD is not required, the rest are mandatory in Scrum.



Question 68:

True or False. Cross-functional teams are optimized in a technical layer of a system.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

A cross-functional team is one that has all types of expertise that is required to develop the product. Note that this is about the team as a whole, not individual team members. Being cross-functional means that you can work (as a team) comfortably on all technical layers of the system.



Question 69:

What is the main reason for the Scrum Master to be at the Daily Scrum?

The Developers have asked the Scrum Master to facilitate their Daily Scrum.
To make sure that every Developer answers the three questions.
To assign tasks to Developers.
To get a report on progress of the Sprint.


Answer: A.



Explanation

Developers are self-managed and take care of their work and progress. The Scrum Master is focused on the context, not content. In general, Daily Scrum is for the Developers, which means that only the Developers participate. Others can attend as listeners. Well, unless it's about a Scrum Master facilitating the meeting (not so common), in which case "listeners" might talk. Listeners can be the Product Owner or even stakeholders, there is nothing that prohibits this.



Question 70:

Which of the following actions may a Scrum Master take in starting up a project?

Ask the Product Owner to explain the project, its business needs, history, goals, and context.
Ask the development managers to introduce their departments and capabilities.
Ask the team to work together and prepare a complete Product Backlog.
Ensure that there’s a clear understanding of the whole scope of the project.
None of the answers apply.
All answers apply.


Answer: A.



Explanation

We don't know the whole scope of the project in the beginning, so we will keep learning from Sprint to Sprint. Product Backlog is never complete and it's Product Owners responsibility not the Scrum Master. It has to be about the project and people internal to it, not the external departments. Remember that the team is cross-functional and does everything needed for the project, without outside help.



Question 71:

What type of test should be done during the Sprint?

All tests, except for integration tests
All tests, except for user acceptance tests
Unit tests
Every type of test


Answer: D.



Explanation

Remember that the Increment has to be "Done", and potentially releasable. It means that all tests should be done.



Question 72:

Who resolves team conflicts within the Developers?

The Scrum Master
The Team Leader
The Developers
Stakeholders
The whole Scrum Team
The customer


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Developers should be able to resolve internal conflicts. If they can't succeed, they should ask the Scrum Master for help.



Question 73:

True or False. If you do Scrum you must release your software at the end of each Sprint.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint, but it's up to the Product Owner to decide if it will be released.



Question 74:

Which of the following should not change during the Sprint? (Select the best two answers)

Sprint Backlog
Sprint Goal
Definition of Done
Product Backlog


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

Sprint Goal and Definition of Done should remain the same. Sprint Backlog can change from the Developers during the Sprint. Product Owner can keep adding items in the Product Backlog, during the Sprint, this doesn't change Developers' work.



Question 75:

When is the Sprint over?

When the Sprint Backlog tasks are done
When all Sprint Backlog items are done
When the Scrum Master announces the end of the Sprint
When the Product Owner cancels the Sprint


Answer: D.



Explanation

The Product Owner has the authority to cancel a Sprint. If there was an option about timebox, it's true that the Sprint is over when the timebox expires.



Question 76:

When is a Product Backlog item ready?

When it doesn’t take more than one week to be developed.
When the Product Owner is happy with it.
When all tasks and acceptance criteria required for its completion are identified.
When it can be Done within one Sprint.


Answer: D.



Explanation

There is no Definition of Ready in Scrum, however the Scrum Guide states "Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event."



Question 77:

Which of the following may not be done in the Sprint Retrospective meeting?

Discuss the Product Backlog items for the next Sprint
Discuss the Definition of Done
Calculate Velocity
Refining the Product Backlog
Improve the way that they communicate


Answer: A, C, D.



Explanation

Sprint Retrospective is about the way they work. It's about the things that affect the product, but they don't discuss the product directly. In general, it's about the context, not the content. For example, they talk about the way Product Backlog is refined, but they won't refine the Product Backlog in the Sprint Retrospective meeting.



Question 78:

Which of the following may not be done when the team becomes mature enough during the project? (Select the best three answers)

They may end up improving their Definition of Done.
They might be more productive.
They can release every Sprint.
They may not need a Scrum Master anymore.
They will need longer Sprint Retrospectives.


Answer: C, D, E.



Explanation

They can be more productive as they know more about the product and the team members. The Definition of Done shouldn't change in the middle of the Sprint, but they might end up updating it, in their Retrospective. After all, Increments are always potentially releasable, even if the team is not mature enough.



Question 79:

A Developer has notified the Scrum Master of a potential data security risk. What action should the Scrum Master take?

Ask the Developer to share the issue with the team as soon as possible.
Notify the test team.
Add a Product Backlog item to address the security issue.
Wait until the Sprint Retrospective to add security to the Definition of Done.


Answer: A.



Explanation

It is best to coach the Developers to collaborate on issues regardless of severity. They may consult the Scrum Master of Product Owner if needed. They need to have the courage to raise this.



Question 80:

Who may add new work to the Sprint Backlog during the Sprint?

Stakeholders
The whole Scrum Team
The Scrum Master
The Developers
The Business Analyst
The Project Manager


Answer: D.



Explanation

There's no separate Business Analyst accountability in Scrum. There's no project manager in Scrum. The Developers own the Sprint Backlog and if they finish early enough and they decide they can bring items from the top of the Product Backlog (self-managed).

Chapter 5: PSPOTM I Full Mock Test 4
Time Limit: 60 minutes        No. of Questions: 80.



Question 1:

True or False. Scrum Teams should normalize their estimations, so that management can measure and compare their performance.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Progress measurements are done internally, not by external managers. Also, comparing the velocity dependent on the estimates of two different teams is never reliable, and it's not productive.



Question 2:

A Scrum Master is working with Developers in different geographical locations. The Developers meet in a variety of meeting rooms and have much to do logistically (for example, set up conference calls, book the place) before the Daily Scrum. What action should the Scrum Master take in this situation?

The Scrum Master should set up a meeting and announce them how it will be addressed
Ask the Developers to alternate who is responsible for the meeting setup. This will make them accountable.
Ask the development manager to solve it as it is an impediment
Allow the Developers to self-manage and determine by themselves what to do. This will make the team more self-managing.


Answer: D.



Explanation

Scrum Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. This includes deciding how to form teams when multiple teams are needed. The resulting synergy optimizes the teams overall efficiency and effectiveness. They are self-managing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Developers how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality.



Question 3:

Commitment is one of the Scrum values. Which of the following statements best describes it?

It’s about delivering all the items in the Sprint Backlog.
It’s about dedication, and the intent and effort put into work.
It’s about achieving the result that you have committed to.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Scrum values are commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect. The Scrum Theory Pillars are Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation.



Question 4:

What should the Developers do when they face issues delivering an item because they don't understand it?

Complete as much of the item as possible, and use it in the Sprint Review meeting
Ask the Scrum Master to help with this impediment.
All answers apply
Move the item back to the Product Backlog.
Create a better understanding of what is needed.
Collaborate with the Product Owner to see what’s possible and desirable.


Answer: F.



Explanation

The Product Owner is responsible for explaining the items. Developers should try to understand and develop the item instead of sending it back and they should go with their best guess because this may create a lot of rework, it should be well defined and has all the functional requirements.



Question 5:

Which statement does not explain when an item is considered complete?

None of the answers apply.
All answers apply.
The item has all the quality requirements defined by the Product Owner.
When it’s potentially usable for the end users, if it becomes part of the Increment
When everything is done based on the Definition of Done
When it can be part of a potentially releasable Increment


Answer: C.



Explanation

It doesn't mean that it's done if the item satisfies the customer and end users. A Product Backlog item that you have in the Sprint Backlog is Done, when it can be part of the Increment, which means that reflects the Definition of Done. Make sure you have noticed the word "not" in the question.



Question 6:

Which of the following actions may a Scrum Master take in starting up a project? (Select the best two answers)

Ask the Developers to introduce themselves to each other and tell about their skills and background.
Ask the Product Owner to explain the project, its business needs, history, goals, and context.
Ask the development managers to introduce their departments and capabilities.
Ask the team to work together and prepare a complete Product Backlog.
Ensure that team members have clear accountabilities and responsibilities.


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

They share accountability, and they do not have different accountabilities and responsibilities. It has to be about the project and people internal to it, not the external departments. Remember that the team is cross-functional and does everything needed for the project, without outside help. Product Backlog is never complete.



Question 7:

The timebox of this Scrum Event should be no more than eight hours.

Release Planning
Sprint
Release Sprint
Sprint Planning
Sprint Retrospective
Sprint Review


Answer: D.



Explanation

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.



Question 8:

How much time does the Product Owner spend on Product Backlog refinement?

Not more than 30% of their time
Usually not more than 5% of their time
Usually not more than 20% of their time
As much as needed


Answer: D.



Explanation

It's an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Developers usually assist with this.



Question 9:

Whose decision is it to establish the tasks to be performed during the Sprint?

The Team Leader.
None of the answers apply.
The Developers
The Scrum Master.
The Product Owner.
All answers apply.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Developers are self-managed, hence its members decide on the way they work and on the technical approach of the project.



Question 10:

Which of the following best describes the way a Product Owner can order the items in the Product Backlog?

Based on risk, riskier items on the top
Based on risk, safer items on the top
Based on size, larger items on the top
Based on value, more valuable items on the top


Answer: D.



Explanation

Product Owner's responsibility is to maximize the value of the Product Backlog, so items are ordered accordingly.



Question 11:

Who is required to attend the Daily Scrum?

The Developers and the Scrum Master
The Developers and the Product Owner
The Developers
The whole Scrum Team


Answer: C.



Explanation

Daily Scrum is mandatory for the Developers only they can participate and talk. However others can join as listeners. There is nothing in the Scrum Guide that prohibits this.



Question 12:

Which of the following has the most to do with capturing and using lessons learned?

Product Backlog refinement
Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospective
Sprint Planning


Answer: C.



Explanation

Sprint Retrospective is about discussing the way work was done and finding ways to improve it next time; this is mainly about lessons learned.



Question 13:

True or False. Each item in the Sprint Backlog is owned by one or a pair of Developers.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

All Developers share ownership and stay accountable for the whole Sprint Backlog.



Question 14:

True or False. The Sprint Review should be done before the Sprint Retrospective.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

As stated in the Scrum Guide: The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint. This is useful to discuss in the Sprint Retrospective potential feedback from the Sprint Review.



Question 15:

True or False. Some items in Sprint Backlogs are not directly about the features and functions of the product.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

It is true as you can have non-functional requirements in the Sprint Backlog.



Question 16:

True or False. The Scrum Team is self-managed, therefore, they can decide to drop Daily Scrums.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

They are self-managed but they can not change the Scrum framework. It is not acceptable to drop Daily Scrum.



Question 17:

Which of the following statements can be considered real outputs of a Sprint? (Select the best two answers)

A plan for the next Sprints
A potentially releasable piece of software
An Increment of working software
An Increment of software with minor known bugs in it


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

If you know that there's a bug, you should fix it before calling it "Done". The real output is the Increment: a piece of working software that meets the Definition of Done. From a wider perspective, you can also consider the feedback that is generated by the customer and the improvements you plan in the Sprint Retrospective as real outputs, but a question like this is focused on the product, and on checking if you can distinguish DONE items from technical tasks; the former is valuable for us, but the latter is just the means to an end.



Question 18:

Which of the following describes the relationship between the Product Backlog and changes in the project environment?

The old baselined Product Backlog would be saved, and a new one would be created for the rest of the project.
The Product Backlog should be kept high-level enough to tolerate such changes.
It evolves to reflect the changes
There’s no effect on the Product Backlog.


Answer: C.



Explanation

If there's a new regulation, and you have to comply with it in your software. You investigate the regulation and create new items that cover it, and you may also change some of the existing items. The Product Backlog is not baselined, it has just enough details, but not so high-level that can tolerate all changes.



Question 19:

Which of the following is not correct about the Scrum Master accountability?

Makes sure that the Developers have Daily Scrums
Estimates the value of Product Backlog items
Causing the removal of impediments
Helps the organization implement Scrum
All answers apply
None of the answers apply


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog management. The rest of the options are Scrum Master's accountability.



Question 20:

Which of the following are not allowed in Scrum? (Select the best two answers)

Integration Sprints
Release Sprints
Release Planning
Using User Stories
Using Planning Poker


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

As stated in the Scrum Guide "A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint." If something is not mentioned in the Scrum Guide it is not mandatory, but also not prohibited, like User Stories, Planning Poker, Release Planning.



Question 21:

The Developers realize that they have over-committed themselves for the Sprint. How should they review and adjust the work?

They shouldn’t make any changes to the Sprint Backlog.
They should ask the Product Owner to cancel the Sprint.
They can get help from the Product Owner to adjust the Sprint Backlog.
They can make any adjustments by themselves, because they own the Sprint Backlog.


Answer: C.



Explanation

They should be open and speak to the Product Owner about it. They can negotiate with the Product Owner about the items. The Sprint is cancelled when the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, not when we see that we can't deliver all items. Nothing bad happens if you don't deliver everything.



Question 22:

Which of the following can be considered a real output of a Sprint?

A document that describes the architecture of the software and can be used by the Developers in the rest of the project
A set of tests designed to be used in the next Sprint
An Increment of software with minor known bugs in it
A potentially releasable piece of software


Answer: D.



Explanation

If we are aware of a bug, we should fix it before calling it "Done". Increment is a piece of working software that meets the Definition of Done.



Question 23:

Who is responsible for engaging stakeholders?

The Product Owner
The Project Manager
The Developers
The Scrum Master


Answer: A.



Explanation

Engagement of stakeholders is mostly about and around the Product Backlog items. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, so she/he has to create items that reflect maximum value. That's why this is mainly the responsibility of the Product Owner to keep them engaged. The rest of them can help in different ways, but it is mainly the Product Owner.



Question 24:

You are the Scrum Master for a Scrum Team. One of the Developers approaches you and tells you that during the Sprint they don't complete full regression testing for all of the selected Product Backlog Items. Regression testing is part of the agreed Definition of Done. The Developers have discussed with the Product Owner and decided to change the Definition of Done (DoD) to remove regression testing. Which actions are most inappropriate? (Select the best two answers)

Ask the team coaching questions. Eg. ask the Developers and the Product Owner what problem they will be solving by removing regression testing from the Definition of Done. Will this raise transparency or improve the quality of the Increment?
Agree with altering the Definition of Done as the Developers and Product Owner agree. We need to make our Scrum Team self-managing.
Disagree with the Developers decision and tell them that having a better Definition of Done is important for the quality of the product, and they should follow it.
Ask the team some powerful questions. Eg. ask the Developers and Product Owner, “Will removing regression testing from the Definition of Done allow the team to produce potentially releasable Increments at the end of every Sprint?


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality. Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done. Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress. Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.



Question 25:

True or False. When multiple teams are working on the same product, their Sprints should start and end at the same date.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

It's not mandatory in the Scrum Guide to start and end the Sprints at the same time. That makes it much more difficult to manage the whole project. However It's not mandatory for many teams to be aligned on this, because you may need it in certain cases: maybe some teams are working on parts of the project that need longer Sprints, while others need shorter ones.



Question 26:

Which of the following statements could be outputs of the Sprint Planning meeting? (Select the best two answers)

Items selected from the Product Backlog
Order of items in the Product Backlog
Estimations for the sizes of items
Tasks
Resource assignment


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

Sprint Planning is an event that answers three questions: "Why is this Sprint valuable?", "What can be Done this Sprint?" and "How will the chosen work get done?" Tasks and Items from Product Backlog are the only options that can be obtained from these questions of the Sprint Planning event.



Question 27:

Which of the following statements describe something that may be done in the Sprint Retrospective meeting? (Select the best three answers)

Calculate Velocity
Discuss techniques used to facilitate the Sprint Retrospective meeting
Discuss the composition of the team
Refining the Product Backlog
Discuss the Product Backlog items for the next Sprint
Discuss tools used to communicate with remote team members


Answer: B, C, F.



Explanation

Calculate Velocity is usually something that you do before Sprint Review meetings. Refinement is done continuously during the Sprint. Product Backlog items for the next Sprint is not something to discuss during Sprint Retrospectives, Sprint Review could be a better place. Sprint Retrospective is about the way we work. It's about the things that affect the product, but we don't discuss the product directly. It's about the context, not the content.



Question 28:

What would likely happen if management only changed the organization’s current terminology to fit Scrum without the proper understanding and support of Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide?

The organization may not realize the real benefits of Scrum as there would be no real change on the way the teams work.
Organizations may feel less stressed as the behaviors would remain familiar to management.
None of the answers apply.
Very little change will happen as the vocabulary in Scrum is specifically defined for implementing Serum.
All answers apply.


Answer: E.



Explanation

The defined terminology in Scrum was selected, designed, and defined specifically for supporting the Scrum Framework. Understanding the differences between traditional methods and the Scrum Framework will help move teams in the right direction in Scrum adoption.



Question 29:

Which of the following are Scrum Pillars?

Courage
Inspection
Creativity
Adaptation
Transparency
Commitment


Answer: B, D, E.



Explanation

Pillars are transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Make sure you're not confusing these pillars with the Scrum values commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect.



Question 30:

If a Scrum Team has one week Sprints, when should we have a potentially releasable product?

Often during the Sprint
When the Product Owner finds it necessary
Every 3 to 5 Sprints
After each Hardening Sprint


Answer: A.



Explanation

There are no hardening Sprints. There should be at least one Increment at the end of each Sprint that is potentially releasable. The shorter the feedback loop the better.



Question 31:

Which of the following statements are correct when four teams are working on a product? (Select the best three answers)

There can be multiple Scrum Masters.
There can be multiple Product Owners.
There is only one Product Backlog.
There can be multiple Product Backlogs.
There are multiple Sprint Backlogs each Sprint.
There is only one Sprint Backlog each Sprint.


Answer: A, C, E.



Explanation

Product Owners is one person not a committee and he/she owns one single Product Backlog. Each team has separate Sprint Backlog and Scrum Events and the Product Owner assists each one of them.



Question 32:

Who is responsible for explaining the Product Backlog items?

Scrum Master
Customer
Product Owner
The Developers are self-managed and have to talk to anyone necessary, and find out the meanings of items.
User representatives


Answer: C.



Explanation

It's one of the responsibilities of the Product Owner to explain what each item in the Product Backlog means and make sure that everyone has the right understanding. This is done when the item is first defined, and also during the Sprint and/or refinement when the Developers are working on the item and may have doubts.



Question 33:

True or False. Developers should be cross-functional

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The whole Scrum Team is cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint, as stated in the Scrum Guide (not just the Developers).



Question 34:

True or False. Time can be allocated between two Sprints for integration.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Each Sprint starts immediately after the previous one. There's nothing between the two Sprints. It should be continuous integration. Something is not Done unless it's integrated and it is released in the Sprint. There are no Integration Sprints.



Question 35:

Which statement is correct about the Sprint Backlog?

It has just enough details.
It has no details.
It has all the details.


Answer: A.



Explanation

Both Sprint Backlog and Product Backlog evolve more information as time passes, so they have just enough information to move to the next stage e.g. during refinement, Sprint Planning etc.



Question 36:

The Developers have realized that one of the planned tasks in the Sprint Backlog is not needed anymore. What should they do?

Inform the Product Owner, so that he/she can cancel the Sprint.
Remove it if it’s OK with the Product Owner.
Keep it, but inform the Product Owner.
Ask the Product Owner to remove it.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Developers own the Sprint Backlog, and they make changes to it. They don't even have to ask the Product Owner, if it's about a non-functional requirement. Product Owner's consultation is needed when it's about functions/features. Sprints are cancelled when the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, it's not the case here.



Question 37:

Which of the following is not a feedback loop in Scrum?

Sprint Review
All answers apply
None of the answers apply
Sprint Planning
Sprint Retrospective
Product Backlog refinement


Answer: F.



Explanation

Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective are formal opportunities for inspecting and adapting, and are considered "feedback loops".

What's the role of a Product Owner during Sprint Retrospectives?

Summarizing and report the results of the meeting to stakeholders
Participating as a Scrum Team member
None of the answers apply
They should not participate in this meeting
Capturing requirements for the Product Backlog
All answers apply


Answer: B.



Explanation

The whole Scrum Team can participate in the Sprint Retrospective and they work together to see how they can improve the way they work in the next Sprint. There is no difference between PRoduct Owner, Developer or Scrum Master.



Question 39:

What should be the timebox of Sprint Retrospective when there are 6 Developers in the team and Sprints are two weeks long?

4 hours
3 hours
8 hours
1.5 hours


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Sprint Retrospective is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. Note that the duration of events is not dependent on the number of Developers.



Question 40:

Who should know the least about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and be able to explain the alternatives most clearly?

The Project Manager
The Developers
The Product Owner
The Scrum Master


Answer: A, B, D.



Explanation

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog, which includes that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next. Make sure you have noticed the word "least" in the question.



Question 41:

Which are two good approaches for the Developers to make non-functional requirements visible?

QA must run integration and regression tests before the end of the Sprint.
Add them to the Product Backlog and keep the Product Owner informed of the estimated effort.
Create one special Product Backlog only for these requirements.
Add them to the acceptance criteria as part of the Definition of Done.


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

Non-functional requirements should be visible to the Product Owner. The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog but always can and must consider the feedback and opinion from other stakeholders including the Developers who can influence to add new items in Product Backlog.



Question 42:

Who tracks the remaining work of a current Sprint?

The Developers
The Project Manager
The Product Owner
Stakeholders
The Solution Architect

Ask the Developers to help refine the Product Backlog instead of starting the first Sprint.
Let the Sprint begin, but only with the goal of completing the Product Backlog.
Let the team start the first Sprint, and continue refining the Product Backlog.


Answer: C.



Explanation

First, remember that the Product Backlog is never complete, and you don't have to wait until you have everything in the Product Backlog to start the first Sprint. However, this question says that the backlog is not ready, which probably means that the items at the top are too large and/or unclear. Again, having unready items is not a reason to wait, it's undesirable though, but you can refine them during the Sprint.



Question 21:

Question 30:

Raffaele is a Scrum Master helping an organization to establish five Scrum Teams that will be developing a product. Raffaele discusses with the teams the high level of integration that the product Increment will require by the end of their first Sprint. It is a highly anticipated product, both by consumers and by the organization. Of the options raised by the future team members, which option should Raffaele encourage?

Each Scrum Team delivers done Increments in its own area of responsibility. Upon functional acceptance at the Sprint Review, the code is isolated for future stabilization. The release date is adjusted according to the expected work and time of such integration phase.
Each team provides a separate Increment with the functionality added by the individual team. The Sprint Review is used to identify the work needed to integrate with the other teams. This work is then added to the Product Backlog.
In the first Sprint, integration ¡s less important. The goal is to deliver business value. Functionality that is not integrated with the work of other Scrum Teams by the end of a Sprint is still reviewed to assess its potential business value. It can still be released at the Product Owner’s discretion, and silent consent of the stakeholders.
All Scrum Teams agree on a shared Definition of Done describing all work needed to deliver an Increment for review that is the integrated sum of the work of all Scrum Teams on the initiative.


Answer: D.



Explanation

As stated in the Scrum Guide "If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done."

It is not mandatory to have exactly 3 people as Product Owners. Each Product should have a single Product Owner. You can also have two Product Owners for three products and one of them has to manage two products, that's why we have to be careful in the wording of the options.



Question 32:

Who is accountable to know the most about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and be able to explain clearly the alternatives?

The Release Manager
The Scrum Master
The Delivery Manager
The Development Manager
The Developers
The Product Owner


Answer: F.



Explanation

The Product Owner needs to make sure that he keeps the Developers updated with what the clients & stakeholders need. The Scrum Master is there to coach him/her on how to do it.



Question 33:

Which of the following should not change during the Sprint?

Definition of Done
Product Backlog
Sprint Backlog
Minimum level of quality


Answer: D.



Explanation

Product Backlog may change at any time. The level of expected quality shouldn't decrease during the Sprint. The tasks in the Sprint Backlog are always changing as more is learnt. Also, The Scrum Guide is not against changing the "items" in the Sprint Backlog either. Those that stay fixed during the Sprint are needed to avoid distractions, and create a more productive environment. After all, Sprints are not so long that they create problems.



Question 34:

Who has the final say on the order of the Product Backlog?

The Developers
The Scrum Master
All answers apply
The Stakeholders
The Product Owner
The CEO


Answer: E.



Explanation

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.



Question 35:

Who must do the work required for Product Backlog items, in order to create a potentially releasable Increment?

The Scrum Team.
The Developers
The Scrum Master
The Product Owner


Answer: B.



Explanation

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint, as stated in the Scrum Guide.



Question 36:

Upon what type of process control is Scrum based?

Complex
Hybrid
Empirical
Defined


Answer: C.



Explanation

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.



Question 37:

True or False. It is mandatory that the product Increment be released to production at the end of each Sprint.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The product Increment should be usable and releasable at the end of every Sprint, but it does not have to be released. It's the Product Owner's decision to release it.



Question 38:

The Scrum Values promote Scrum Teams to be cross-functional and have all the skills needed to build a product within the team. While starting Scrum, what would be the advantages of keeping the existing component teams (e.g. design, database, back-end, front-end)?

Component teams generally have all the skills needed to deliver shippable Increments that add business value.
There is less communication overhead than working in feature teams.
Component teams would have all the skills needed to focus on their specific technical layer.
Because their productivity is already predictable, they can deliver shippable Increments more quickly than a newly formed team.
Because they have been working together for some time, there will be less initial disruption than a newly formed team. As they begin working, they will discover what works best and how to move towards cross-functional teams.


Answer: E.



Explanation

The ones that will be doing the work are the best ones to decide on what Scrum Team structures work best.



Question 39:

When does the next Sprint begin?

When the Product Owner is ready.
Next Monday.
Immediately following the next Sprint Planning.
Immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.


Answer: D.



Explanation

A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. There is no gap between them.



Question 40:

True or False. Each increment is independent from the previous one

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.



Question 41:

What's the commitment of the Increment?

Definition of Done
Sprint Goal
Definition of Ready
Product Goal


Answer: A.



Explanation

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.



Question 42:

How does the Product Owner manage the value of the product?

Product Backlog Order
User Acceptance Testing
MoSCow Analysis
Customer feedback via frequent releases


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

Product Owner's responsibility is to manage the Product Backlog, so that maximum value can be delivered. He/She can achieve this via frequent releases so that the feedback loop is as short as possible.



Question 43:

How should a Scrum Master respond if the Product Owner plans the first Sprint to only focus on setting up the infrastructure and architecture in order to work on functionality in a subsequent Sprint?

Support the Product Owner’s decision as he/she is accountable for maximizing the value of the work that the Developers do.
Help the Product Owner understand the value of including business functionality into every Sprint and explain to him/her that the best architecture and infrastructure emerge alongside the development of the functionality.
Explain that one Sprint may be too short to finish the architecture and he should pre-allocate subsequent Sprints just in case.
Add at least one technical architect to the Scrum Team to ensure the architecture can be completed in the first Sprint.


Answer: B.



Explanation

Improving communications with the customers and stakeholders is a crucial activity in Scrum. It reduces waste from building items that add no value. Saying that, the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-managing teams.



Question 44:

You are the Scrum Master for four Scrum Teams working on one product. Several of the Developers notify you that their teams will need full-time help from an external technical specialist Helen in the upcoming two Sprints. What key concerns should the Scrum Master take into account?

Maintaining a consistent velocity.
The benefit of teams solving the problem themselves and the
ability to produce integrated Increments.
Hiring additional resources to fill the void in the skill set.
Having enough work for all team members.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Scrum Master needs to coach the Developers to work in a way that they don't depend on Helen and they can take ownership of this issue by themselves.



Question 45:

Veronica is a Scrum Master of a new team that is going to start a new Project. Which of the following actions may Veronica take in starting up the Project? (Select the best three answers)

Ask the Developers to discuss and identify the way they are going to develop the product.
Ensure that a bonus system is in place for the top performance of individuals.
Ask the Developers to introduce themselves to each other and describe their skills and background.
Ask the Product Owner to explain the project, its business needs, history, goals, and context.
Ask the development managers to introduce their departments and capabilities.
Ensure that team members have clear roles and responsibilities.


Answer: A, C, D.



Explanation

The rest are wrong because: Having a reward system is harmful to the unity of the team. Members share accountability, and they do not have different roles and responsibilities. It has to be about the project and the people internal to it, not the external departments. Remember that the team is cross-functional and does everything needed for the project, without outside help.



Question 46:

John is the Product Owner of two Scrum Teams. Which of the following statements are true? (Select the best two answers)

Optimizing the value of the work the Developers perform.
Is another name for the Project Manager.
All his time must be dedicated to a single project.
Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions.


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Developers and prioritize the Product Backlog items accordingly. There is no accountability of Project Manager or equivalent in the Scrum framework.



Question 47:

The Developers are trying to convince Alexander the Product Owner that the Sprint should be cancelled with no obvious reason. What's the right response from Nina the Scrum Master to do?

Nina should tell the Developers that it is okay. The Product Owner knows more about it.
Nina should encourage Alexander to discuss it with the customer first.
Nina should be involved in making this decision.
Nina should stop this, because the Developers do not have the authority to influence Sprint cancellation


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Product Owner is the only person who can cancel the Sprint. Developers can raise concerns but not without any specific reason. Product Owners receive input from everyone who's involved in the project when they are making their decisions and they know more about it.



Question 48:

During a Sprint, a Scrum Team determines that it will not be able to finish the complete forecast. Who should be present to review and adjust the Sprint work selected?

None of the answers apply
All answers apply
The Product Owner and the Developers.
The Developers.
The Scrum Master, the project manager and the Developers.
The Product Owner and all stakeholders.


Answer: C.



Explanation

During the Sprint, scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Developers as more is learned.



Question 49:

Which of the following do the Developers do during the first Sprint? (Select the best two answers)

Develop a plan for the rest of the release.
Determine the complete architecture and infrastructure for the product.
Deliver an Increment of potentially releasable software.
Create the complete Product Backlog to be developed in subsequent Sprints.
Develop and deliver at least one piece of functionality.


Answer: C, E.



Explanation

The core of Scrum is a Sprint, a timebox of one month or less during which a "Done", usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. This applies to every Sprint.



Question 50:

At the beginning of the Sprint, the Developers don't have the tools and infrastructure needed to complete the current Sprint Backlog Items. What of the following statements are least appropriate for the Scrum Master to do? (Select the best two answers)

The Increment for current Sprint will focus on delivering infrastructure and tool acquisition.
Improve communication between the Product Owner and Developers in order to establish a plausible Sprint Goal and a proper Definition of Done.
Talk with the Product Owner in order to accept partially done Increments.
Help the Developers to get tools and improve infrastructure while Definition of Done is adapted accordingly.


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

Infrastructure and tools are not prepared upfront, because it requires a complete understanding of the whole project and product, which is usually not the case, so we need to hold on to the adaptation pillar. The required infrastructure and tools will be prepared gradually through the project because they depend on the product we’re going to create, which in turn is defined through the project. Make sure you have noticed the "least appropriate" in the question.



Question 51:

Who keeps track of the remaining work in the Product Backlog?

The Product Owner
The Developers
Senior Executives
The Scrum Team
The Scrum Master
The CEO


Answer: A.



Explanation

Product Owner's responsibility is to manage the Product Backlog, so that maximum value can be delivered. He/She is the one who knows more about it.



Question 52:

You are a Scrum Master and were asked to conduct an interview by management for a new team member. Which characteristics would you look for in the candidate?

Experience as Team Leader
Skilled Tester
Team Player
Generalizing Specialist


Answer: D.



Explanation

Generalizing Specialists are most preferred in a Scrum Team. They can perform more than one role/accountability.



Question 53:

Which of the below are accountabilities on a Scrum Team?

Developers
Users
Scrum Master
Product Owner
Customers


Answer: A, C, D.



Explanation

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Developers, and a Scrum Master.



Question 54:

What is the main reason for the Scrum Master to be at the Daily Scrum?

He or she does not have to be there; he or she only has to ensure the Developers have a Daily Scrum.
To gather status and progress information to report to management.
To make sure every team member answers the three questions.
To write down any changes to the Sprint Backlog, including adding new items, and tracking progress on the burn-down.


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Developers participate in the Daily Scrum. Others can join as listeners though.



Question 55:

What represents the trend line in a burndown chart, through a Sprint?

The changes of the cost through the current Sprint.
The amount of remaining technical debt.
The remaining work to be completed if nothing changes on the
Sprint Backlog or the Scrum Team.
The date when the Scrum Team can be released for other work.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The trend line gives us visibility about the forecast for the finishing date, considering a constant Scrum Team capacity for the Sprint Backlog.



Question 56:

The Product Backlog is ordered by _________

Whatever is deemed most appropriate by the Product Owner.
Items are randomly arranged.
Risk, where safer items are at the top, and riskier items are at the bottom.
Size, where small items are at the top and large items are at the bottom.
Least valuable items at the top to most valuable at the bottom.


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Product Owner decides what makes the most sense to optimize the value of the work being done by the Developers.



Question 57:

The Product Owner is not working with the Developers during the Sprint. What would you do as a Scrum Master?

Talk to the functional manager of the Product Owner.
Cancel the Sprint and start training the Product Owner.
Nominate someone else as the proxy Product Owner.
Bring up the issue in the next Sprint Retrospective.


Answer: D.



Explanation

There's no proxy Product Owner in Scrum. It's best to resolve issues internally, without managers. This is not a valid reason for canceling a Sprint, and if it was only the Product Owner can cancel the Sprint.



Question 58:

Which of the following are optional in Scrum? (Select the best two answers)

Velocity
Backlog
Burndown
Increment
Definition of Done


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

Burndown and Velocity are not mentioned in the Scrum Guide, however they are useful and they are mostly used by the Scrum Teams.



Question 59:

From the following options, what is the best way a Scrum Master can increase the team productivity?

Breaking down the most valued Product Backlog items.
Causing the removal of impediments and facilitating Scrum events if requested.
Implementing a control change board.
Assigning tasks to Developers.


Answer: B.



Explanation

Causing the removal of impediments and facilitating the Scrum events as requested or needed are the kind of things expected from the Scrum Master. The Scrum Team is self-managed, the Scrum Master must ensure the Product Owner knows how to prioritize the Product Backlog to maximize its value, but the Scrum Master is not responsible for doing so.



Question 60:

Which of the following statements do not explain when a Product Backlog item is considered complete? (Select the best two answers)

The item is ready for user acceptance testing
When the customer approves its completeness
When everything is done based on the Definition of Done
When there’s nothing more we need to do before it can be used by end users


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

We can't consider it Done when user acceptance testing is not done. If we are aware of something that it's missing we should implement it, before considering it Done. A Product Backlog item that you have in the Sprint Backlog is Done, when it can be part of a Done Increment. Increments have to be Done based on the Definition of Done.



Question 61:

A baselined Product Backlog is called __________

Release Plan
Ready
Sprint Backlog
Product Road map
It is never baselined, ¡t is a living artifact
All answers apply


Answer: E.



Explanation

The product backlog is often called a living artifact, since it is continuously updated to reflect changes in the project and customer feedback.



Question 62:

The timebox for a Daily Scrum is ________

15 minutes for a 4 week Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.
15 minutes.
Two minutes per person.
The same time of day every day.
4 hours.


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Daily Scrum is timeboxed at 15 minutes, it does not change depending on the length of a Sprint.



Question 63:

Which statement best describes a Product Owner's responsibility?

Optimizing the value of the work the Developers do.
Directing the Developers.
Keep stakeholders from distracting the Developers.
Managing the project and ensuring that the work meets the commitments to the stakeholders.


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Developers and making sure that the Product Backlog reflects maximum value towards the Product Goal.



Question 64:

True or False. Work that does not meet the Definition of Done should be completed in the next Sprint.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

It should be moved in the Product Backlog and let the Product Owner decide what to do with it.



Question 65:

True or False. Multiple Scrum Teams should use the Definition of Ready to normalize estimations. This way it will be easier to measure and compare their performance

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

There are no comparable estimation units between the Scrum Teams, each team is different. Definition of Ready is a common practice, but is not mandatory in Scrum. The purpose of DoR is not normalizing estimations or performance measuring anyway.



Question 66:

True or False. Scrum does not have an accountability called Project Manager.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

A Scrum Team has a Scrum Master, a Product Owner and Developers. As a whole they have all controls needed and Project Manager is not an accountability in Scrum.



Question 67:

A new Developer has just joined an existing team that has been together for several Sprints. During the Sprint, the individual has been trying to share his ideas and viewpoints but is continuously ignored by the rest of the Developers. Which Scrum Values has the Scrum Team been neglecting? (Select the best three answers)

Commitment
Openness
Courage
Respect
Focus
Transparency


Answer: B, C, D.



Explanation

The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on challenging problems. The Scrum Team agrees to be open to discuss all the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum Team members respect each other’s skills, experience and opinions.



Question 68:

When does a Developer become the sole owner of a Sprint Backlog item?

Never. All Sprint Backlog Items are “owned” by all Developers, even though each one may be implemented by an individual member.
Whenever a team member can accommodate more work.
During the Daily Scrum.
At the Sprint planning meeting.


Answer: A.



Explanation

Sprint Backlog and all of its items are collectively owned by the Developers. No individual Developer can claim ownership over an item as this would block communication and collaboration.



Question 69:

True or False. Stakeholders are prohibited to be present in the Daily Scrum

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Stakeholders can be in Daily Scrum as listeners, however only the Developers must participate and talk.



Question 70:

An organization has decided to adopt Scrum, but management wants to change the terminology to fit with terminology already used. What will likely happen if this is done?

Management may feel less anxious.
The organization may not understand what has changed with Scrum and the benefits of Scrum may be lost.
All answers apply
Without a new vocabulary as a reminder of the change, very little change may actually happen.
None of the answers apply


Answer: C.



Explanation

It's not easy to transform an organization that is new to Scrum, it will take time to see the benefit of it. Forming the organization takes time, and members often go through recognizable stages as they change from being a group of individuals to a team with common goals. Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing model describes these stages by Bruce Tuckman. When you understand it, you can help your new team become effective more quickly.



Question 71:

What is the timebox for a Sprint Planning meeting?

8 hours for a monthly Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.
4 hours.
Monthly
Whenever it is done.


Answer: A.



Explanation

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.



Question 72:

What should be the duration of a Sprint?

Short enough to be able to synchronize the development work with other business processes.
Sufficiently short to maintain acceptable business risks for the product owner.
None of the answers apply
No more than one month.
All of the answers apply


Answer: E.



Explanation

All these choices are correct criteria in deciding the duration of a Sprint. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.



Question 73:

Stakeholders joined the Daily Scrum of a Scrum Team to add a really urgent Bug in the Sprint Backlog. Developers immediately understood that they have to fix it as soon as possible, so they added it into the Sprint Backlog. Which of the following statements is wrong?

The fact that stakeholders joined the Daily Scrum.
The fact that the Developers accepted work from stakeholders.
The fact that the Developers didn’t redirect the stakeholders to the Product Owner.
The fact that stakeholders spoke in the Daily Scrum.


Answer: B, C, D.



Explanation

It is acceptable for the stakeholders to join the Daily Scrum, but they can only be there as listeners, they shouldn't interrupt the Developers. Even if stakeholders approach the Developers directly, they should be redirected to the Product Owner and if it is really urgent, PO could even cancel the Sprint, depending on what is going on with the Bug.



Question 74:

Who creates the Definition of Done?

The organization (or the Scrum Team if none is available from the organization).
The Scrum Master as he/she is responsible for the Developers’ productivity
The Product Owner as he/she is responsible for the product’s success
The Developers


Answer: A.



Explanation

Note that it was the responsibility of the Developer to create the Definition of Done in the previous versions of the Scrum Guide, but it's the whole Scrum Team now. As stated in the Scrum Guide "The Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product."



Question 75:

True or False. A 2x increase in the number of Developers will double productivity.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

When more Developers are added to the team, there's usually a short-term decrease in productivity because other members have to spend time and effort familiarizing the new members with the solution and the environment of the project. After a while, the existence of new members may increase productivity, but even if it does, it's usually not a linear increase because, for example, having more people increases communication channels, which consumes some of the capacity.



Question 76:

At the end of the Sprint the Developers have agreed to release the increment even if there is a part of it that doesn't meet the Definition of Done. The Product Owner said that it is alright, because they did Manual Testing instead of Test Automation. What shouldn't happen in this case?

The Developers shouldn’t tell the Product Owner that they should do Test Automation.
They should discuss this in the Sprint Retrospective.
The Serum Master shouldn’t be involved. Quality is not her/his responsibility.
The Serum Master should ask coaching questions like “Do you think that the increment will give the same value with the missing testing?”
They should extend the Sprint until they finish Test Automation
They should add the Test Automation in the Product Backlog to avoid Technical Debt


Answer: A, C, E.



Explanation

The Scrum Master should ask coaching questions when something is not properly followed (DoD). They shouldn't extend the Sprint, they should either exclude it from the increment or add it in the Product Backlog to avoid Technical Debt.



Question 77:

When is a Sprint over?

When the Product Owner says it is done.
When all Product Backlog items meet their Definition of Done.
When the timebox expires.
When all the tasks are completed.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The duration of a Sprint is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. A Sprint starts immediately after the end of the previous one.



Question 78:

During a Sprint, the customer complains that a critical functionality is missing. Which Scrum Events they might have to attend to provide feedback about the expected features?

Daily Scrum
Sprint Review
Sprint Planning
Sprint Retrospective
Product Backlog refinement


Answer: B.



Explanation

During Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next, so the customers could be there to provide feedback. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.



Question 79:

Which artifact contains a plan for making visible the Sprint Goal?

Product Backlog
Increment
Sprint Backlog


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal. Sprint Goal is the commitment. The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint.



Question 80:

What is the accountability of Management in Scrum?

Support the Product Owner with insights and information into high value product and system capabilities. Support the Scrum Master to cause organizational change that fosters empiricism, self-management, bottom-up intelligence, and intelligent release of software.
Monitor the Developers’ productivity.
Identity and remove people that aren’t working hard enough.
Continually monitor staffing levels of the Developers.


Answer: A.



Explanation

Management has no active accountability in the actual product development through Scrum. However, management external to the Scrum Team is incredibly important in setting the vision and strategy to guide the overall direction of the organization.

Question 1:

True or False. The Product Owner can allow the Developers to create and add items to the Product Backlog.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

Product Owners are allowed to delegate some of their responsibilities to other team members. The Product Owner is still staying accountable for it.



Question 2:

True or False. If stakeholders want to add a new item in the Product Backlog, they have to convince the Product Owner.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.



Question 3:

A key stakeholder tells the Developers to cancel the current Sprint as the customer that requested this work has left the company, so the Sprint Goal is obsolete now. What should happen in this case?

Cancel the Sprint, as it is really obvious the Sprint Goal is obsolete.
The Scrum Master should coach the stakeholders for ways to raise their concerns.
Developers should refer the key stakeholder to the Product Owner and let him decide if the Sprint Goal is obsolete.
The Scrum Master should coach the stakeholders that they should never speak to the Developers directly, they should go through the Product Owner.
This is the only case that stakeholders could cancel a Sprint.


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

Only the Product Owner has the right to cancel a Sprint, no matter what's the reason behind it. Stakeholders can talk directly to the Developers, they should collaborate if needed. The Scrum Master should always be there to coach when needed.



Question 4:

Which of the following statements best describe Lean thinking in Scrum?

Focuses on the essentials
Improves quality
Reduces waste
Limits the work in progress


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

As stated in the Scrum Guide "Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials."



Question 5:

True or False. Always must be a Release after each Sprint.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The main purpose of the Sprint is to create an Increment of usable, and potentially releasable “Done” product. It's up to the Product Owner if it will be released.



Question 6:

What is the level of definition needed for the Sprint Backlog through the Sprint Planning?

None of the answers apply.
The entire Sprint Backlog work must be identified and estimated by the end of the Sprint Planning.
Enough to disaggregate tasks for the Scrum Team to establish the whole Sprint effort.
Enough to allow the Developers to create their best forecast about what they can do as a result of the incoming Sprint, and to start the first several days of the Sprint.
All answers apply.
Enough to understand infrastructure requirements.


Answer: D.



Explanation

The Sprint Planning priority is covering three topics: Why is this Sprint valuable? What can be Done this Sprint? & How will the chosen work get done? The team doesn’t need to get all the details about every task as long as these questions are answered and the pending definition can be completed as soon as possible in refinement activities.



Question 7:

The Product Owner says that the customer has security concerns. Where can these concerns be addressed in Scrum? (Select the best two answers)

Can be added to the Product Backlog.
Can be handled in a special dedicated Sprint.
Can be handled by security experts contractors in some moment.
Can be handled in the Definition of Done.


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

Many non-functional features, like security, can be added as acceptance criteria and tests in the Definition of Done to be applied to all or some Product Backlog items. We can have some specific security concerns that can be items in the Product Backlog. The Developers are cross-functional and self-sufficient, and should be capable of taking care of every aspect of the product, including security.



Question 8:

Which of the following is a requirement before starting a Sprint Planning event?

Having the requirements specified and completely reflected in the Product Backlog
Having the Product Backlog items clearly described and assigned to developers
None of the answers apply.
Having the items at the top of the Product Backlog small enough to fit into one Sprint
All answers apply.


Answer: C.



Explanation

Each Sprint Planning starts immediately after the Sprint Retrospective of the previous Sprint, which means there's nothing happening before the Sprint Planning. There is nothing that could stop the Developers from starting the Sprint. Even if they haven't done refinement they should start the Sprint and they will split the items as more is learnt.



Question 9:

True or False. The Product Owner can delegate some of their responsibilities to the Developers.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

Product Owners are allowed to delegate some of their responsibilities to other team members. If they do, the Product Owner stays accountable. Note: "responsible" is the person who's doing the task and "accountable" is the person who supervises it and is ultimately answerable for the task. The Product Owner is always accountable for the Product Backlog; they are also responsible unless they delegate this responsibility. These two words are often mixed though, so don't be shocked if you see that "responsible" is used to mean "accountable" sometimes.



Question 10:

Which of the following is misleading about the Increment?

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint.
Each Increment is not additive to all prior Increments
It may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint.
It is a concrete stepping stone toward the Sprint Goal


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint and may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint.



Question 11:

What does a trend line through a release burndown chart indicate?

The budgeted cost of the project
When the remaining work ¡s supposed to be finished
When the remaining work will likely be completed if nothing changes in the Product Backlog or the Scrum Team
When the project will likely finish, if the team develops with a speed equal to the last Sprint


Answer: C.



Explanation

During a release, a product is transferred from the development team to the customer. The release burndown chart shows the team progress towards the release date by plotting the remaining effort against the ideal effort. If the remaining effort line or bar is above the ideal effort, the team is behind the schedule.



Question 12:

True or False. The Definition of Done can change during the project.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

Yes, it can be improved during the project. However, it doesn't change in the middle of a Sprint. During each Retrospective the Scrum Team could improve it if necessary.



Question 13:

True or False. Sprint Review is a meeting for receiving a customer's formal confirmation.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Sprint Review is a Scrum Event not a meeting. It happens internally in the organization. All Scrum events are designed to be transparent, and to be used for inspection, and ultimately, adaptation.



Question 14:

Which of the following statements is a valid service from a Scrum Master to a Product Owner?

Help the Product Owner order the Product Backlog items in order to maximize value.
Act as the middleman between the Product Owner and the Developers, as requested or required.
Act as a proxy when the Product Owner is not available to the team.
Help the Product Owner find techniques for managing the Product Backlog.


Answer: D.



Explanation

It has to be coaching/training rather than doing the actual work. For example, helping the Product Owner order the backlog is not a good idea, but helping them understand how to order the backlog is a good one.



Question 15:

True or False. Stakeholders are only allowed to meet with the Scrum Team at Sprint Review.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Improving communications with the stakeholders is a crucial activity in Scrum, as working with them frequently ensures the team can focus on the right things to build. Although it is useful to have stakeholders not only at Sprint Review, but also maybe during Product Backlog refinement. There should be collaboration between the Developers and the stakeholder to make sure that Developers are aligned with the value needed by the customers.



Question 16:

In this event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders talk and collaborate about what was done in the Sprint, in order to share the Sprint progress.

Sprint Review.
Sprint Retrospective.
All answers apply.
Daily Scrum.


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Sprint Review event is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. Attendees also collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.



Question 17:

True or False. Only the Developers are required to attend the Daily Scrum meeting.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

It is mandatory for the Developers to be there and participate. However, others could join as listeners.



Question 18:

What topics does the Sprint Planning address?

How will the chosen work get done?
Who is going to work with who?
What can be Done this Sprint?
Why is this Sprint valuable?
Is there enough work to keep everyone busy full-time?


Answer: A, C, D.



Explanation

Sprint Planning has nothing to do with who is doing what. It has to do with the work for the next Sprint and has to cover these three topics. Why is this Sprint valuable? What can be Done this Sprint? and How will the chosen work get done?



Question 19:

The timebox of this Scrum Event should be one month or less.

Release Sprint
Release Planning
Sprint
None of the answers apply
Hardening Sprint


Answer: C.



Explanation

Sprints are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.



Question 20:

True or False. The Sprint Backlog contains only pulled items from Product Backlog.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Of course, the Sprint Backlog contains the selected Product Backlog items but not just that. It also contains the tasks for the current Sprint which have agreed in the Sprint Planning for the delivery plan. (non-functional items, like testing etc.)



Question 21:

Which of the following is not a Developer responsibility?

Estimate the work needed for Sprint Backlog items.
All answers apply.
Measuring the performance of the Sprint.
Ordering the Product Backlog items.
Deal with internal team conflicts.
None of the answers apply.


Answer: D.



Explanation

Remember that Developers are self-managed. Therefore, It is team’ responsibility to measure its own productivity and performance throughout the Sprint, figure out its own process, plan, estimate and optimize the work required for items and the Sprint Goal, and to resolve their own conflicts.



Question 22:

Peter is a new Product Owner on a newly formed Scrum Team. Peter has projected a product completion date based on an estimated velocity of 21 completed points per Sprint. After the first 3 Sprints, the Developers have determined that their maximum velocity is 15 points and they are unable to create shippable Increments at the end of each Sprint. What is the best way to proceed?

Inform Peter that the projected completion date is not correct. The Developers would estimate the remaining work to produce a shippable Increment and suggest completing it (make it meet the Definition of Done). Based on empirical data, Peter can adjust the completion date and decide how to continue.
Extend the Sprint in order to complete the Sprint Backlog items.
The Scrum Master would coach the team on improving their estimations and commitment to completing the Sprint Backlog.
The Sprints have failed to produce shippable Increments therefore opportunities to inspect and adapt are lost. The Scrum Master would encourage the organization to add more team members in order to increase the team’s capacity.


Answer: A.



Explanation

This needs to be communicated with the Product Owner and provide better transparency.



Question 23:

Why is it a good practice to include tests in the Definition of Done? (Select the best three answers)

Because the progress will be easier to show in burndown charts.
Because the results are likely to be releasable.
Because it can simplify requirement definitions.
Because it adds transparency to final Increments.


Answer: B, C, D.



Explanation

The Scrum Team has a common understanding of what a finished job (Done). With this purpose, we can increase Transparency when there are tests included in the Definition of Done, which will verify how close the work is to being complete and becoming a real Increment usable for final users.



Question 24:

Which of the following is the most proper situation during the Sprint Planning considering that we have seven Scrum Teams working in a single product?

The Product Owner meets only with some representatives from each team to select items from the Product Backlog. Then each representative works with his/her team to create their Sprint Backlog and dependencies are avoided for special escalation Sprints.
All team members meet and together create one Sprint Backlog for the Sprint, in which everyone will work.
Everyone meets at the same place at the same time, Scrum Teams can nominate a smaller number of appropriate people to represent the team on early discussions that are carried out at escalation level, the Product Owner gives information and then every dependency is discussed and coordinated by the teams. Team members can be shifted as needed and Sprint Backlogs for each Scrum Team are created.


Answer: C.



Explanation

There should be only one Product Backlog and one Product Owner for one product. Each team needs to have a separate Sprint Backlog. The Developers are responsible for selecting the items from the Product Backlog, however, they can select representatives to do so. They share ownership of these though. Team members can change the composition of teams between Sprints. Even though Product Backlog items should be independent of each other, the dependencies between teams are unavoidable in scaled Scrum and they need to be handled.



Question 25:

True or False. Each Sprint Backlog item is owned by one Developer.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

All members of the Scrum Team share the accountability of the tasks, not specific Developers. The whole Scrum Team is cross-functional, not a single Developer.



Question 26:

When the Developers find themselves in a situation where they don’t have the proper tools and infrastructure, what are the best actions to do? (Select the best two answers)

A Sprint Zero is created to focus on infrastructure instead of creating an Increment.
The team must create a realistic Definition of Done under current circumstances.
Coach the Developers to improve its skills, tools, and infrastructure over time and adjust the Definition of Done accordingly.
The Developers can’t implement Scrum. They have to use other methods.


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

Sprint Zero does not exist in the Scrum framework and all the Sprints should be able to create an Increment of working software. The Inspections and Adaptation concepts are about making adjustments gradually through the project, this includes infrastructure and tools.



Question 27:

True or False. The Sprint Backlog does not contain items pulled only from the Product Backlog.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

We can’t change the Sprint Goal, however, the team can talk and negotiate with the Product Owner in order to add new Sprint Backlog Items as needed or add non-functional requirements (testing, etc).



Question 28:

How should the members of multiple teams be composed for a single project?

All Answers apply.
Scrum Master chooses the team members for each team.
Management chooses the team members for each team.
The Product Owner chooses the team members for each team.
Developers themselves will decide the team's composition.
Everyone together will decide on how to form the teams.


Answer: E.



Explanation

Developers should be self-managed and they’re responsible for team formations and composition.



Question 29:

True or False. The Product Owner is required to be involved for the sizing of the Product Backlog items.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.



Question 30:

Stakeholders can participate in this Scrum Event.

Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospective
Daily Scrum
Sprint Planning


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed. Stakeholders could also attend Daily Scrum, but only as listeners. In the Sprint Planning the team might invite others to give advice to it could be the Stakeholders.



Question 31:

Bill Gates, the CEO of your organization and one of the most important customers, asked some Developers to add a new feature in the middle of the Sprint. What should they do?

Add the new feature to the Sprint Backlog.
Replace an item in the current Sprint Backlog with the new one.
Reject the request.
Refer them to the Product Owner.
Add the new feature to the Product Backlog.


Answer: D.



Explanation

One of the main responsibilities of the Product Owner is to maximize the value of the Developers' work, and he’s the only one who can add new items to the Product Backlog. Even when the Developers own the Sprint Backlog, the members can’t add items like this, the Product Owner must make sure that any new item adds value and she or he can work with proper stakeholders about it and then add it to the Product Backlog for the next Sprints. Also, the Product Owner can reject the new feature, rather than the Developers.



Question 32:

True or False. All the Scrum Artifacts are designed to maximize transparency of key information.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.



Question 33:

During Sprint Planning, the Scrum Team has some doubts about a few items at the top of the Product Backlog. The Product Owner, Angel, tries to contact the customer to talk to them about the meanings of the items, but all the customer representatives are in a meeting and won't be out until two hours after the planned finish of Sprint Planning. What would you advise, as the Scrum Master?

Cancel the Sprint Planning meeting, give them some time to prepare, and then hold another Sprint Planning.
Extend the duration of Sprint Planning and ask them to discuss the items more and reach agreement.
None of the answers apply.
All answers apply.
Cancel the Sprint and start the next one when the items are clear.
Ask the Developers to come up with their best guess and don’t worry too much about their capacity.


Answer: F.



Explanation

Sprint Planning has a timebox that can't change and Scrum events are mandatory, nobody can cancel one of them(Sprint Planning or Sprint). The Developers should go with the best guess, if they need to bring more tickets, they will do it later in the Sprint.



Question 34:

What amount of work should the Developers do to a selected Product Backlog item to complete the Sprint?

As much as needed in adherence to the definition of “Done’
Requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, documentation and some maintenance.
All the needed work including some improvements.
As much as they can do in the Sprint.


Answer: A.



Explanation

The agreed Definition of Done for the Scrum Team, is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment in order to deliver an Increments of potentially releasable functionality.



Question 35:

Which of the following statements are true about Scrum? (Select the best two answers)

Simple to understand and difficult to master.
Scrum is a methodology for managing complex projects.
Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems.
Sprints maximum length is six weeks


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

Scrum is not a methodology or body of knowledge, it is a framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.



Question 36:

Which of the following statements are true about the Scrum Master? (Select the best three answers)

Serves the Scrum Team in several ways.
Is responsible for updating the burndown chart
Is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
It’s a management position.
Coaching the Developers in self-management and cross functionality.


Answer: A, D, E.



Explanation

Despite the Scrum Master not managing people, he manages the processes. That’s why it’s considered management accountability. The Scrum Team is self-managed, the Scrum Master can coach and help but the Developers handle the progress and performance of the Sprints. Finally, It is the Product Owner who owns the Product Backlog.



Question 37:

Scaled Scrum is one that conforms to Scrum and uses more than one team for one or more Sprints.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

Scaled Scrum conforms to Scrum, it's compatible with Scrum. It's called scaled Scrum when there is more than one team. However, it's not necessary to have more than one team in all Sprints, it can be for some of them.



Question 38:

When should the Scrum Team hold the Sprint Retrospective meeting?

At the end of each project.
When the Product Owner and the Scrum Master determine that is needed.
At the end of each Release.
At the end of each Sprint.
At the beginning of each Sprint.


Answer: D.



Explanation

The Sprint Retrospective occurs always after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.



Question 39:

Which of the following are the best approaches that a Scrum Master could take when a Scrum Team doesn’t have the proper infrastructure to do the work needed to complete the selected Product Backlog items? (Select the best two answers)

Suspend the project.
Suspend the Sprint.
Help the Scrum Team to create proper Sprint Goal and Definition of Done accordingly under current circumstances.
Coach the Developers to improve infrastructure while adjusting the Definition of Done properly.
Create a special Sprint to get infrastructure instead of creating an Increment.


Answer: C, D.



Explanation

The infrastructure and tools are prepared gradually throughout the project, and the Sprint Goal and Definition of Done should be realistic and created accordingly.



Question 40:

How much of the Sprint Backlog needs to be defined throughout the Sprint Planning meeting?

Just enough for the Product Owner to be able to assign tasks to Developers.
None of the answers apply.
All answers apply.
Absolutely all the work.
Just enough to create the baseline for the whole project.
Just enough, so that the Developers can estimate what they can do and to start the work on the first days of the Sprint.


Answer: F.



Explanation

Scrum does not do upfront planning, only a few tasks broken down from the items are created in the Sprint Planning. The Developers are self-managed, their members decide who does what and there is no baseline for a Scrum project.



Question 41:

The Developers cannot forecast how much work they can do in the upcoming Sprint, because of uncertainties in the Product Backlog that the Product Owner is not able to overcome. What of the following actions should the Scrum Master recommend? (Select the best two answers)

Ask the Developers to come up with their best guess and do not worry too much about their capacity.
Extend the duration of Sprint Planning and ask them to discuss the items more and get into agreement.
Invite everyone to discuss this problem in the next Sprint Retrospective and try to find a solution.
Cancel the Sprint Planning meeting, give them some time to prepare, and then hold another Sprint Planning.
Cancel the Sprint and start the next one when the items are clear.


Answer: A, C.



Explanation

Sprints are canceled when the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete and this can only happen from the PO, not for reasons such as this. What happens is that you will start the next Sprint and the next Sprint Planning right away. Remember, Sprints start one after the other, and we don't do anything outside the Sprints. Sprint Planning is timeboxed, we can't extend it. Developers should pick a number of items (best guess). If it's not enough, you can pick more later. If it's too many, you will just deliver as many as you can. Nothing bad happens if you don't deliver all items in the Sprint Backlog. The goal is to generate value, not to develop all items in the backlog.



Question 42:

True or False. The structure of the Daily Scrum is set by the Developers.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Developers own the Daily Scrum meetings, they can be conducted in different ways but always focus on progress toward the Sprint Goal.



Question 43:

A Scrum Team found out in the Sprint Retrospective that their main issue is that they do not focus on the most valuable items during their Sprint. What Scrum Values? Which Scrum Values are demonstrated by focusing on the most valuable items first? (Select the best three answers)

Transparency
Respect
Inspection
Focus
Self-management
Courage


Answer: B, D, F.



Explanation

The Scrum Values are Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness, and Respect. Make sure you are not confusing them with the Scrum Pillars (transparency, inspection, and adaptation).



Question 44:

The Developers and the Product Owner are not working together at all. What should the Scrum Master do?

Coach the Product Owner and the Developers about Scrum values and Incremental delivery.
Restart the Sprint.
Send everybody to a Scrum capacitation course and restart the project.
Report the Product Owner to her/his manager.


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Scrum Master must coach the whole Scrum Team members in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood to practice agility. The Scrum Master must help them to effectively communicate with each other, but be careful, don’t act as a go-between for them.



Question 45:

During Sprint Planning, the Product Backlog items are often decomposed into smaller work items. Ideally, how long should these smaller items take to be completed?

One day or less
One Sprint
One week or less
One month or less


Answer: A.



Explanation

For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less.



Question 46:

Who is responsible for getting buy-in from stakeholders?

The Developers
The Scrum Master
The Product Owner
The Project Manager


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Product Owner is responsible for getting buy-in, understanding the stakeholders’ concerns and goals. The Product Owner communicates and represents the desires of the customer.



Question 47:

How often should the composition of the team change?

Every Sprint, to encourage creativity and openness
Never, because it reduces productivity
As needed, without a need to be concerned about changes in productivity
As needed, considering that it will have a short-term reduction in productivity


Answer: D.



Explanation

In the beginning other team members have to help to bring new members up to speed so a small reduction in productivity is expected.



Question 48:

A few members of the Scrum Team discuss work that is not being done. A few Developers support that it is part of the Definition of Done, others say it isn't. What are the best actions for the Scrum Master to take in such a situation?

Organize a meeting with the people involved aside. Ask them to resolve this outside of the team and maybe involve their line managers
Remind the Scrum Team of the Scrum Values.
Defuse the prevailing conflict. Teach the Developers how to interpret the Definition of Done. This will help the team to autonomously decide whether the debated work is or is not part of it.
Remind the team that conflicting ideas are natural but making it personal should be avoided.
Decide by yourself if work is part of Definition of Done.
Organize a session and coach the team. Help the entire team resolve the conflict by themselves and create a uniform Definition of Done.


Answer: B, D.



Explanation

Conflict is not bad for a team, but members must have respect for each other. Instead of arguing, both the team members must express their point of view and have a constructive discussion. When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, everyone must have a common understanding of what “Done” means. Although this may vary significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This is the Definition of Done for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment. In self-managed teams creativity thrives, conflicts can be resolved, and new possibilities are explored.



Question 49:

A Stakeholder requests from the Product Owner to push forward a specific Product Backlog item, but the Product Owner knows that it is not that valuable and decides not to build it anytime soon. Which Scrum Values are the Product Owner showing? (Select the best two answers)

Maximize value
Adaptation
Passion
Transparency
Courage
Focus


Answer: E, F.



Explanation

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.



Question 50:

A Scrum Team of 6 members is working on building a new application to support Payroll processes in their organization. Darren is a new Developer and he added an additional feature in the Increment which is not part of the Product Backlog. He did it because he was approached directly by one of the business stakeholders and only took him 30 min to implement the requirements. This was discovered just before the Sprint Review by other Developers. What should the Developers do? (Select the best two answers)

The Developers should retain the feature in the Increment but do not present it to the stakeholders.
Darren should ask the Product Owner to add this feature to the Product Backlog because it is already part of the Increment.
The Developers should remove the feature from the Increment.
The Developers should inform the Scrum Master about the request and remove Darren from the Team.
They should discuss the issue in the Sprint Retrospective.


Answer: C, E.



Explanation

As per the Scrum Guide, "The Product Backlog is an ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team. Since the requirement did not originate from Product Backlog, it must be removed from the Increment. The team should also discuss this matter in the Sprint Retrospective so that everyone is aware of this rule. It is not justifiable to add this requirement in the Product Backlog just because it is already part of the Increment. Scrum Teams must follow the Scrum Values. Everything the team does should be transparent. Hiding the information from the Product Owner is not a good approach. Scrum Master does not remove individuals from the team for these kinds of mistakes. Scrum Master understands that mistakes are expected but the Team should learn from it.



Question 51:

Which element is not an attribute of Product Backlog items?

Estimate
Owner
Order
Description


Answer: B.



Explanation

Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.



Question 52:

True or False. Lower positioned, Product Backlog items, are usually larger and less clear than those on the top.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

When Product Backlog is created, items are added to it. They have different sizes and eventually are ordered on their business value. The most valued items will be on the top and usually, these items would be broken down into smaller ones. We don’t do this with those items on the bottom. That’s why usually larger and less clear items are on the bottom of the Product Backlog.



Question 53:

The Sprint Backlog includes _______________

Tasks
Tests
Use Cases
All answers apply, since are a decomposition of the selected Product Backlog items
None of the answers apply
User Stories


Answer: D.



Explanation

User Stories, Use Cases, Tests, Tasks and even other elements which help to define and clarify the work can be part of the Sprint Backlog.



Question 54:

True or False. When multiple teams are working on the same product, one person can be a Developer of more than one Scrum Team.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

None of the Scrum accountabilities are necessarily full-time, and a single person can occupy more than one accountability or the same one in more than one team e.g., there may be a special expertise that is needed in multiple teams, but it's not needed on a full-time basis. So, one person can provide that special type of expertise to multiple teams. However, it's not recommended to have a person switching between projects, it's not productive.



Question 55:

True or not. The Product Owner decides how many Product Backlog items should be selected for the next Sprint.

Correct, based on the agreements with the customer.
False
Incorrect, the PMO decides that.
Incorrect, the Scrum master decides that.
Correct


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner sets the objective that the Sprint should achieve although can be influenced by the Developers. However, only Developers create the Increment, that’s why only they pull the Product Backlog items in order to accomplish Sprint Goal.



Question 56:

True or False. It is required to use Acceptance Criteria in the Product Backlog items.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

It's a good idea to use Acceptance Criteria to capture the requirements, but it's not mandatory.



Question 57:

Who must express clearly the Product Backlog items?

The Project Manager
The Product Owner
The Scrum Master
The Developers


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Owner owns the Product Backlog and is the sole person responsible for it. The Product Owner does Product Backlog management, like ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.



Question 58:

True or False. When we have more risk we need longer Sprints.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

When we have shorter Sprints, there are more opportunities to show progress, and receive feedback, validate our knowledge and therefore Adapt. The longer the Sprint, the higher the risk.



Question 59:

What’s the main responsibility of the Project Manager?

Create a project charter.
Help the team to implement good practices.
There’s no Project Manager accountability in Scrum.
Constantly verify the programmers’ results.


Answer: C.



Explanation

In Scrum we have only three accounts: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master and the Developers. It’s not permitted to define new accountabilities.



Question 60:

True or False. Every Increment should be released.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Every Increment should be potentially releasable and completed based on the Definition of Done. However, Increment doesn’t have to be actually released. The Product Owner decides if it makes sense to release or not.



Question 61:

What's the normal timeboxed duration of Sprint Planning when there are 6 Developers in the team and Sprints are two weeks long?

8 hours
4 hours
3 hours
12 hours


Answer: B.



Explanation

The timeboxed duration for Sprint Planning is 8 hours in a one-month Sprint, and normally shorter for shorter Sprints. If you have a shorter Sprint, it's not mandatory to shorten the timeboxed durations proportionally, but it's the normal thing to do. The key is the word "normal", we expect it to be shorter. if it was a "must" it would be 8 hours. Note that the duration of events is not dependent on the number of Developers.



Question 62:

What is the right criteria to order the Product Backlog?

Items are randomly arranged.
Safer items are at the top, and riskier items are at the bottom.
Whatever is deemed most appropriate by the Product Owner.
The customer always decides.


Answer: C.



Explanation

The decision on the order of items can be influenced by a committee, the customer, or any other stakeholder, but only the Product Owner decides what makes the most sense to optimize the value of the work being done by the Developers. The PO has the final word.



Question 63:

Which of the following are the results of the Sprint Planning? (Select the best two answers)

Sprint Backlog.
Sprint Goal.
Complete Sprint Acceptance Criteria
Complete Sprint Documentation.


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

The Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog are created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The rest could change as more is learnt.



Question 64:

True or False. The Developers should prepare a complete infrastructure and set of tools for the project during the first Sprint.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Developers neither analyze, design nor describe the complete architecture and infrastructure, beforehand for the whole project. Agile processes are characterized by frequent short bursts of design, just enough to reach the Sprint Goal.



Question 65:

What is the Scrum accountability who knows the most about the project performance?

The Product Owner.
The Scrum Master.
The Product Manager.
The Developers
The Scrum Team.


Answer: A.



Explanation

The Product Owner is responsible for measuring project performance. The Developers only measure the performance of the current Sprint.



Question 66:

True or False. The Scrum Master should not allow the Sprint Planning meeting to start when the Sprint Goal is not ready.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Sprint Goal is prepared during the Sprint Planning meeting. Also, Scrum Masters don't order people, they teach and convince people to do the right thing.



Question 67:

True or False. Only Product Backlog items that have been refined enough can be selected for the Sprint Backlog.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

If they are not Refined enough, the Developers should go with the best guess. Items that are not ready will be refined during the Sprint.



Question 68:

Which of the following can be reasons for the Scrum Master to attend the Daily Scrum?

To tell Developers what to do.
It’s not necessary for the Scrum Master to be in the meeting.
The Developers have asked the Scrum Master to facilitate their Daily Scrum.
To participate as a Scrum Team member
To get a report on progress of the Sprint.


Answer: B, C.



Explanation

The Scrum Master facilitates the meetings as requested or required. Daily Scrum is not for the Scrum Team, it's for the Developers (however anyone can join as a listener).



Question 69:

Which of the following statements best describe the purpose of having a Definition of Done? (Select the best three answers)

As the Developers are doing the work, they provide guidance on the remaining work needed to create the potentially shippable Increment by the end of the Sprint.
It helps the Scrum Team decide how much time is needed before the Sprint can end.
It creates transparency and provides a common understanding of the ‘done’ state of the Increment at the Sprint Review.
It helps the Developers defer any pending work to subsequent Sprints.
It provides guidance to the Developers when they are forecasting their Sprint Backlog during the Sprint Planning.
It is a checklist to monitor the Developers’ progress on a task.


Answer: A, C, E.



Explanation

When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as Done, everyone must understand what Done means. Scrum Team members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment. This Definition of Done provides the team guidance on what it takes to make the Increment shippable.



Question 70:

Who can remove and replace Sprint Backlog items during the Sprint?

The Product Owner.
The Developers and the Product Owner.
The Developers
The Scrum Master.
The Scrum Team.
No one.


Answer: C.



Explanation

Only the Developers can modify the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, can’t modify the Sprint objective though. If there is time and the Developers have completed all the items, the team will pull the next item from the top of the Product Backlog.



Question 71:

What should the Scrum Team do during the Hardening Sprint?

Prepare for the next Sprint.
There is no such thing as a Hardening Sprint.
Code refactoring.
Release the Increment.
Work on technical debt.


Answer: B.



Explanation

There’s no such thing as a Sprint Hardening Sprint. If the stories are correctly prioritized, the Definition of Done is unambiguous, and the Product Backlog is regularly refined based on business priorities, the teams should be able to complete the development tasks.



Question 72:

Which statements are not correct about Daily Scrums?

Developers must answer the 3 standard questions during the meeting.
Stakeholders can watch it.
Only the Developers participate in the meeting.
It’s always a 15-minute time boxed event, no matter how many Developers there are, or how long the Sprint is.
It’s held at the same time and place every day.


Answer: A.



Explanation

It's common to go through the three standard questions, but it's not mandatory. It should be underlined that only the Developers articipate (talk). However others can join as listeners.



Question 73:

A programmer is not working properly and is blocking the progress of the team and their activities constantly. Who should decide about the future of this person as a member of the team?

The management
The Product Owner
The Developers
The Scrum Master


Answer: C.



Explanation

The Developers are self-managed, therefore this is a decision and responsibility of its members. Of course, the Scrum Master must address and support this decision since it is also an impediment.



Question 74:

Which of the following is the most productive way for the Scrum Master to improve the Developers' communications with the Product Owner?

Suggest effective communication tools and techniques to the Product Owner.
Act as a go-between for them.
Teach them how to effectively communicate.
Monitor their communication performance.


Answer: A, C, D.



Explanation

Acting as a go-between is not a sustainable solution. They should be self-managed. Make sure you have noticed the word "most" in the question.



Question 75:

Which of the following are not pillars of empirical process control?

Respect for people, Eliminating Waste
Planning, Demonstration, Retrospective

Question 76:

True or False. Hardening Sprints are needed every few Sprints, to resolve dependencies and reduce technical debt.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

There’s no Hardening Sprint. There’s just one type of Sprint, and its goal is to create an Increment of potentially releasable valuable features.



Question 77:

True or False. Sprint Review is a formal meeting.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

it's a formal event but not a formal meeting, it is for the company internally not the customers. The Scrum Guide states the word formal in two different ways. First, all events are formal opportunities for inspecting and adapting, which basically means a serious opportunity. The second usage is formal meeting, which means a meeting where people approve something and exchange signatures. In that sense, none of the events are formal meetings. In the Sprint Review meeting, for example, the goal is creating feedback and adapting, not contract negotiations and exchanging signatures. The Scrum Guide states this detail: "Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum."



Question 78:

Product Owners should be there when needed, it can be any amount of time.



Question 80:

True or False. Scrum Teams are allowed to use burn-up charts instead of burn-down charts.

True
False


Answer: A.



Explanation

There are different things that can help them in this forecast, but they are all guesses and the Product Owner has to consider everything and adjust the forecast before presenting it to the stakeholders. It's very common to use burn-down charts in Agile, but it's up to the Product Owner to decide how they want to measure and visualize performance of the project, and up to the Developers to decide how they want to do it for Sprints.

Question 1:

Which accountability is the equivalent of Project Manager in Scrum?

Developers
Product Owner
Scrum Master
None of them
Team Leader


Answer: D.



Explanation

There's no project manager accountability in Scrum, and it's not allowed to add new accountability to the existing three. Project management activities are distributed among all of them in the Scrum Team. This is only about the project level, you can always have higher management levels (e.g. program management), and those "can" be compatible with what you do in your Scrum projects. The Scrum Master is considered a role that manages people, but not a Project Manager.



Question 2:

Which two of the following are Scrum Master responsibilities?

Question 3:

What is the most effective way to sort the Product Backlog?

Size
Whatever the Product Owner decides
Complexity
Whatever the Developers decide
Risk

It shouldn’t be longer than one month.
It shouldn’t be longer than 6 weeks.


Answer: A, D.



Explanation

Shorter Sprints provide more adaptation opportunities, which reduces risks. The Scrum Guide states one month as the maximum.



Question 5:

True or False. During the Sprint Review, the Product Owner demonstrates the work that the Scrum Team has completed and answers questions about the Increment.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

As stated in the Scrum Guide: The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.



Question 6:

True or False. The Scrum Master should cancel the Sprint if the Product Owner has not created the Sprint Goal before Sprint Planning.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Scrum Team created the Sprint Goal during the Sprint Planning meeting, not the Product Owner. The Scrum Master can't cancel the Sprint.

Move it back to the Product Backlog.
Do not include it in the Increment.
If the Product Owner is happy with it it can be part of the Increment.
The Sprint will be extended until we complete the item.
It can be added to the Increment if the user acceptance tests are done.


Answer: A, B.



Explanation

It should only be presented as the Increment in the Sprint Review. The Increment should meet the Definition of Done. If an item is not done, we won't include it in the Increment and send it back to the Product Backlog for the Product Owner to decide. Sprints are timeboxed, meaning that we don't extend their duration.

Question 23:

True or False. An increment can only be released after the Sprint Review.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

Scrum doesn’t describe any detailed step, and rather than a methodology is a framework.



Question 54:

True or False. The higher the velocity of a Scrum Team. the higher the value delivered.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

There's no direct relationship between velocity and value. Different teams have different velocities as well, so we can't compare them. If a Scrum Team works faster on less valuable items, velocity will be higher, but value may be the same, higher, or lower.



Question 55:

True or False. Eventually, the Scrum Master becomes unnecessary when the Developers mature through the project.

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

If a project does not include Scrum Master or Product Owner accountabilities, this project is not doing Scrum. Both accountabilities can be part-time but always are performed in a Scrum project. One of the most important Scrum Master activities is causing the removal of impediments, and it doesn’t matter how mature the Developers are, its members will always benefit when someone takes care of these issues.



Question 56:

The Developers have difficulty understanding some of the requirements of the items in the Sprint Backlog. What would you do as a Product Owner?

Ask the Scrum Master to facilitate the communication between you and the Developers.
Attend the Daily Scrums and answer their questions.
Attend the Daily Scrums and remove their impediments.
Spend as much time with them as needed, explaining the items and answering questions.


Answer: D.



Explanation

Attending the Daily Scrum is only for the Developers, not for the Product Owner, it's not the wrong way to approach this but spending time with the Developers is the most appropriate way. The Scrum Master is not needed in this case as there is no conflict between them, it's just a matter of answering some questions, not facilitating the communication between them.



Question 57:

What are the best ways to address performance concerns? (Select the best two answers)

Have special Sprints that ensure those concerns.
Dedicate a certain portion of the team capacity to working on those concerns.
Add them to the Product Backlog.
Add them to the Definition of Done.


Answer: C, D.



Explanation

If it's something that applies to many items and determines the way functional features work, it would be great to add them in the DoD. If it's about the performance of an existing function, adding them in the Product Backlog is reasonable, so you don't allow technical debt to grow. There are no "special" Sprints such as hardening Sprints or integration Sprints.



Question 58:

A Scrum Team has delivered 80 story points in the fourth Sprint and 90 story points in the sixth Sprint. Which one has delivered more value?

Fourth Sprint.
They are the same
It depends

True
False


Answer: B.



Explanation

The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal, this is about the whole product.



Question 68:

Which of the following statements describe benefits of having a Product Goal? (Select the best two answers)
